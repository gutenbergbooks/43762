<h2>The Gnomes of the Saline
Mountains</h2>

<p class="center"><big>A FANTASTIC NARRATIVE</big></p>




<p class="center"><big>I.</big></p>


<p>Though rather early in the morning, the well-known
esplanade along the beautiful Traunsee at
Gmunden, surrounded by green-decked Saline
Mountains, was already thronged to overflowing
with eager-looking sightseers, watching excitedly
the completion of the grandstands which were
now being erected for the great event of the day.</p>

<p>Special trains arrived hourly from Ischel, Aussee,
Hallstadt, and other mountain resorts of
prominence, and the excitement seemed to increase
each moment more and more.</p>

<p>Humdrum life was thrown aside by young and old;
everyone looked on expectantly, reviewing the
grandstands, the tourists, and everything new
around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Fair-browed girls robed in spotless white muslin,
garlanded with flowers and bright with rosy badges
in honor of the occasion, were seen here and there,
while their eyes sparkled and their lips drank from
the cup of happiness, enjoying life and the blessing
of being young.</p>

<p>The constantly increasing throng of summer
visitors and tourists from all parts of the globe,
speaking different languages and wearing outlandish
clothes, made up a bewildering picture,
while the July sun beamed down upon them, and
over lake and green-decked mountain-tops.</p>

<p>The much talked of floral regatta of 1910 was
not to take place until five, but by one o'clock
the grandstands near the water, hardly completed,
began to fill rapidly with the elite of Viennese
society. These floral festivals, which had been
so popular in previous years, were to be surpassed
in artistic splendor and brilliant originality by
today's display of picturesque effects, and
symbolism of national life.</p>

<p>Members of the highest nobility had consented
to take leading parts in the regatta, which was
under the protectorate of the Archduke Victor.
Many celebrities of the musical world, living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
there in their beautiful cottages, were seen quietly
taking their seats. The great bare mountain
"Traunstein" seemed to smile down on them
from his aerial height in friendly approval; they
were no strangers to him, these music giants, but
rather belonged to his enthusiastic admirers.</p>

<p>Every spring they came to him, seeking relaxation
for their over-strained nerves, and every
fall, when his bald head began to be covered with
a cap of snow, they went home full of elasticity
and creative power, often bringing along conceptions
of masterpieces which were later to fill the
entire musical world with admiration. No wonder
then, that the bald-headed old fellow up there
so high above his neighbors looked down so proudly
upon them.</p>

<p>Loud blasts of trumpets in the distance announced
to the patiently awaiting throng the approach
of a long line of richly decorated boats.
Archduke Victor, leading the procession, sat in
the stern of his boat, which was gorgeously arrayed
to represent a bower of field roses. He opened
the festival by throwing red carnations into
the water as far as his hand could reach. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
came the customary exchange of greetings among
the Austrian nobility, whose elaborately decorated
boats were stationed on both sides of the lake.
At their approach, the orchestra on the esplanade
burst forth with the National anthem of Austria,
and the spectators applauded frantically.</p>

<p>Right and left, as far as the eye could see, the
shimmering surface of the lake, with its little,
gently splashing wavelets, was covered with
brightly colored crafts, every one an unique marvel
of its kind.</p>

<p>There came splashing along a huge Easter
egg, made up of lilies of the valley; here a pagoda
of large sunflowers called forth the admiration
of the delighted sightseers.</p>

<p>From the opposite shore there came floating a
half opened Nautilus, out of which a green-clad
naiad cast coquettishly her golden net, trying to
catch some inexperienced young fish in her golden
meshes. Nearby sailed a sleeping beauty (though
rather wide awake) embowered enchantingly in
clusters of American Beauties, looking in all
directions for her enchanted Prince to appear and
make ardent love to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there came, as if by magic, a gondola
from the other side of the lake; it was gorgeously
decorated, shining brightly in the brilliant
afternoon sun. This floating work of art was
made of lotus flowers, over which a canopy of
glittering, diaphanous material was hanging,
presumably as a suitable background for a lady now
the cynosure of all eyes. She was of such entrancing
beauty that all who beheld her sat spellbound
and actually forgot to applaud, according
to the customary greeting to newcomers, scarcely
knowing which to admire first; the magnificent
craft, so artistically constructed, or the dazzling
apparition within.</p>

<p>Amazed and speechless, the distinguished
gathering gazed at her. "Who is she?" they
whispered to each other. Her name was not on
the list of nobilities. Nobody knew anything
about her, but she was gorgeously dressed, her
costume representing that of Cleopatra, made up
of pale green crepe de chine, covered with little
amorettes of silver pearls, which hung loosely in
artistic folds about the luxurious outlines of her
bewitching form. Long flaxen hair, artistically
arranged, set off with diamond sparks, fell about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
her, and shone like molten gold in the setting sun.
It was supposed to be a real reproduction, according
to ancient pictures, of the flirtatious Queen of
Egypt, seen in the art galleries of Florence, Genoa
and Rome. Her large black eyes held a singular
fascination in their sparkling depths, which if
once looked into, fastened themselves upon the
imagination of man to be forgotten no more.</p>

<p>At the sight of all these splendors amid such
exclusive surroundings, she looked with a frightened
stare into space, as if she were a newcomer,
a stranger in this atmosphere of wealth and
distinction. Her features were rigid and white, and
she seemed fascinated, dumb with admiration at
the sight of the splendid surroundings. For this
reason, she had failed to notice the sensation her
beauty had aroused among the masculine sightseers.</p>

<p>A slender man, with deep set eyes, and thin and
bloodless lips tightly pressed together, sat in
an unpretentious little boat a short distance away,
murmuring grimly unintelligible words to himself.
She caught sight of him and sent him a friendly
glance and a smile similar to the greeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of well-known friends. He did not lose sight
of her for a moment, but almost devoured her
with his eyes.</p>

<p>With feverish eagerness he followed her every
movement, knitting his brows threateningly when
any boat of the Viennese "Jeunesse doree" came
with admiring curiosity too near to her's. In
his jealous rage he felt like driving all of
them from the spot.</p>

<p>He began to reproach himself for having yielded
to her cajoling entreaty to be allowed to take
part in the festivity.</p>

<p>"Miserable fops," he murmured contemptuously,
as he contemplated the admiring men with
a scornful sneer. "I loathe the sight of all
these nobodies," he grumblingly soliloquized.</p>

<p>Many of them, in fact, had nothing to boast
about. Many of these so-called nobles in addition
to a noble name, combined magnificent poverty
and an abhorrence for honest work; they acquired
a heap of debts and their inherited estates were
often in the hands of unscrupulous usurers, or
mortgaged to the last cent, while the sneering
one had money in such abundance that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have purchased patents of nobility for an entire
regiment, and still have a reserve revenue from
his unfathomable gold mine in South Africa. His
finances would have allowed him the luxury of
such a woman&mdash;although it must be whispered he
had a wife in England, divorced some people asserted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>II.</big></p>


<p>It was seven o'clock; the great animated festival
drew near its end. At a given signal from the
master of ceremonies, the music on the esplanade
stopped; a hush fell on the distinguished gathering.</p>

<p>Archduke Victor, in his own exalted person,
was to award the stipulated prizes to the boats
of most artistic and original designs.</p>

<p>The fanfares sounded gayly over land and sea,
and all the boats small and large ranged themselves
in a semi-circle about the illustrious judge.
The first prize, a silver statuette of the Goddess
Hebe, was awarded to the fascinating princess of
Egypt.</p>

<p>With a flourish of trumpets, and amid shouts
of applause from the enthusiastic throng, all
looked around for the boat of the prize winner.
But there was no sign of it anywhere, nor was the
single boat of the slender Englishman to be seen
any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>At a given signal from Mr. Ogden, the artistically
constructed little boat had quietly turned
about, and the two, availing themselves of the
general excitement over the awarding of prizes,
had quietly slipped away behind the neighboring
piers, where the palatial home of the unfortunate
Archduke Johann Salvatore is to be seen. He is
better known to the outer world under the pseudonym
"Johann Orth."</p>

<p>His sorrowing mother is still seen by passers-by
sitting near the window with expectant eyes
waiting for the lost son to return.</p>

<p>The brilliant floral festival enacted on the lake
was at an end. On the esplanade were still seen
groups of excited spectators discussing with great
animation once more, the singular disappearance
of the wonderful little boat that was fortunate
enough to win the first prize and whose occupants
disappeared without claiming that distinction.
Others lost no time in entering the brightly
illuminated cafes in the vicinity of the esplanade
to refresh themselves after the excitement of the
grand event.</p>

<p>On the eastern horizon a thin, fleecy scarf of
clouds was visible and the silvery moon with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
her sparkling companions had just come out to
beam upon the scene. The West was a single
shrine of beryl, whereon ruby flakes of vapor
seemed to float through the universe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the much-admired boat was silently
gliding over the surface of the gently splashing
waves. The half reclining form of the fascinating
woman seemed in the amber moonlight to resemble
that of Aphrodite, as if risen from the waves
and in a wanton mood, anxious to make a trial
performance all by herself of her incontestable
power over the other sex.</p>

<p>"Am I really so fascinating? Did those admiring
glances tell the tale of my triumph?" she
murmured with a happy smile to herself, looking
askance at the boat alongside her's, where her
jealous admirer sat with gloomy eyes, consumed
by jealousy.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden, to whom she owed all this splendor,
regarded with unconcealed displeasure the
day's proceedings. He reproached himself for
having yielded to her entreaty. She had begged
and coaxed him so much, until he gave his consent,
then he ordered the decoration of the boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Her costume was especially ordered from the most
expensive tailor according to ancient pictures of
the Egyptian Queen. Ogden undoubtedly wanted
her to be the most striking figure on the lake.</p>

<p>And now! Was he really jealous because she
was the most admired, the most beautiful? "Jealous?
Ho! ho!"</p>

<p>She shrugged her white shoulders with a contemptuous
smile.</p>

<p>Did he really think that she loved him?
"Phew!"</p>

<p>She had only accepted his ardent devotion to
learn what riches and luxury really meant, for
which she had an uncontrollable longing, a longing
that almost devoured her! Night and day she
thought of it, how to get rich.</p>

<p>The aggressive poverty in which she had passed
her earlier days, was too hideous to dwell upon;
she could not think of it without a shudder. The
idea of being poor again took her breath away.
How could she ever have consented to become the
wife of a man who was poor? "Handsome but
poor! What an anomaly!" she said in an undertone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
smiling sarcastically.</p>

<p>With bitter envy and scorn in her painfully
contracted heart, she saw the rich but most ugly
looking women rolling by in their elegant automobiles
disdainfully glancing at her and her poor outfit.
Often enough when she was working,&mdash;engaged in
the performance of her household duties in the
two small dark rooms of a tenement house, without
pure air, without light to brighten her beautiful
face, she cursed everything. This hovel her home!
And she had the priceless gift of beauty! She
made up her mind not to stand it any longer.</p>

<p>The day came when she was seized by such a
consuming desire to go in pursuit of pleasure, to
wear elegant, stylish clothes and feel the admiring
glances of the other sex resting upon her, that
meeting Mr. Ogden by accident and dazzled by his
wealth, captivated by his costly presents, she
accepted his proposal to go with him forgetting
everything, even the sacred duty of a mother.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>III.</big></p>


<p>The much-admired little boat was now approaching
the narrow bay which is only two minutes
distance from Gmunden. There stood the
spick and span victoria of Mr. Ogden; the two
black horses attached to it struck out sparks of
fire with their impatient hoofs. The tall Englishman
who had distanced her, stood there waiting.
The moment he caught sight of her bewitching
face, his eyes sparkled and smiling sweetly
at her, helped her tenderly out of the boat.</p>

<p>The sun had just gone down behind a fleecy
cloud and kindled a volcano, from whose silver-rimmed
crater fiery rays of scarlet shot up almost
to the clear zenith. She looked fatigued and
closed her eyes for a moment. Now she caught
sight of him and smiled, allowing him to take her
away&mdash;</p>

<p>Tenderly kissing her hand, he led her to the
carriage, lifted her carefully in and wrapped a
costly cloak, which was laying there, around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
enchanting form he so adored.</p>

<p>She did not speak, but sat by his side in silence.
He gazed at her several times and then
gave the order to start. The carriage set off
at a rapid gait.</p>

<p>The light of day was rapidly failing. Day and
night seemed to join hands in a twilight mystery;
black clouds were now piling up threateningly on
the western horizon. A heavy gust scattered the
thick aggressive atmosphere. Flying leaves were
lifted up in the air as if by magic, and went
through the wildest dances to the piping and
howling of the storm, which now commenced to rage
in all its fury, while voices of sinister shadows
in the air, seemed to hold intercourse with
others in the distance.</p>

<p>In these high mountainous regions a few moments
suffice to turn a smiling landscape into a
cheerless dripping desert. Claps of thunder and
flashes of lightning followed each other at brief
intervals. The rain now fell in torrents and the
howling storm whipped the green lake whose
wavelets had been so gently splashing half an
hour ago.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>IV.</big></p>


<p>During the events described in the preceding
chapter, a man still in the glow of youth was
walking through the valley surrounded by lofty
saline cliffs, in this howling storm, while clouds
of shrivelled leaves danced above his head. He did
not mind the dreary desolation around him.</p>

<p>His face, naturally strong with manly beauty,
was now pale and haggard, showing unmistakable
traces of a great sorrow. His large intelligent
eyes were now sunk deep in their sockets. A
nervous restlessness made him shiver, and his pale
cheeks gathered only a little color when an
obstinate cough threatened to rend his suffering
breast asunder.</p>

<p>His coat betrayed the elegant cut of the fashionable
tailor, but it was now old and worn, and
hung loosely about his emaciated form. He looked
like a teacher on whom fortune had persistently
turned her back.</p>

<p>He carried in his hands a thick book, carefully
wrapped up in a handkerchief, which he clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
tightly almost tenderly to his breast, as if afraid
at any moment it might escape or drop out of his
hands. This idea made him tremble. It was indeed
his only source of income; by the aid of this
valuable book he had already earned many a gold
piece in the Tyrolian and Styrian mountains.</p>

<p>His humorous lectures had been received with
great approbation in different hotels frequented
by many foreign tourists. And still, his earnings
were not sufficient to support him and his
motherless child, pretty little Marie, whom he had
left in the meantime with a family of friends in
Dresden. Every silver groschen he had earned
was for the support of his child.</p>

<p>He had come all the way from Hallstadt, and this
long walk had exhausted his strength considerably;
and his heart was sick and heavy. Now he felt a
frightful nervousness, fearing not to be able to
reach in time the hotel where he was announced
to deliver his humorous lecture.</p>

<p>He walked as quickly as he could to the farther
end of the valley, where he expected to see
a clearing in the forest, and an open road to the
hotel. But on all sides he met high, unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
cliffs. Apprehension fell over him like an icy
rain.</p>

<p>"Can I have lost my way?" he murmured, breathing
heavily, while great beads of perspiration
broke out on his forehead.</p>

<p>In an hour's time he was supposed to be at the
Mountain View Hotel, and now.... He looked
helplessly around. Darkness began to fall,
contesting every inch of ground with retreating
daylight. His teeth were chattering with a cold
chill, when he set out to find another opening.</p>

<p>The continuous excitement of this wandering from
one hotel to another, the consuming sorrow, the
bleeding wound in his heart, had gradually
undermined his constitution, originally none too
strong, and now this wearing cough, the insidious
fever!... "How upset I feel; it's the peculiar
atmosphere," he said to himself. At the same time
he remembered that the entertainment he proposed
to offer this evening, was not sufficiently
furnished with witty epigrams and bons mots. So,
bowing and smiling to an imaginary audience of
cosmopolitan taste, he began to rehearse his
lecture as he walked on, sharpening the humour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and adding some popular Austrian witticisms in
vogue as trump cards.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up and saw a dark cloud
threatening down upon him. Heavy gusts of
wind commenced to bend the tops of the high,
impenetrable trees. The songs of the mocking
birds rang from the cedars in the distance in
his ear and startled him.</p>

<p>He stopped in alarm and looked distractedly
around him. Where was he? He could not make out.
In the marshy places the fireflies were seen,
wandering about and looking in the distance
like malicious eyes of wicked sprites.</p>

<p>There was no longer any doubt, he had taken
an entirely wrong direction.</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, fearing delay, he
rushed back to look for the right path, while
his hot breath grated audibly on his weak lungs.
A fearful storm was gathering, whispering and
sobbing like complaining, frightened witches
now whirling the leaves into the air vehemently
as if driven by the furies of Hades.</p>

<p>A cold shudder ran through his fevered frame.
He gazed in helpless despair up and down, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
knowing where to turn, while the rain poured
down in torrents, soaking him from head to foot,
and the centuries old tree-tops groaned and moaned
like lost souls in Dante's Inferno. Now everything
began to swim around him. Nature was in an uproar
and bluster. Every little glowworm seemed to his
frightened eyes to grow to gigantic proportions
dancing wildly about.</p>

<p>Sharp flashes of lightning lit up the Traunstein
ever and anon and seemed to come nearer and nearer,
as if trying to march straight down upon him. He
wanted to retreat, but could not move; there was a
dark mist before his eyes. Uttering a piercing cry,
he fell to the ground in a heap because the big
monster kept on advancing.</p>

<p>With a tremendous crash, the great mountain
burst apart and a whole troop of tiny, little mountain
gnomes came out, dancing grotesquely like
sprites of another world.</p>

<p>They were garbed in white vestments, like
fleecy vapors, with brazen girdles which seemed
to be sunbeams, and a cloudy stuff supposed to be
mantles hung loosely around their diminutive
forms. With bare feet they pattered down upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
him. As soon as they caught sight of him they
commenced to giggle, swarming around him in
great merriment. And then they put their ludicrous
little heads together and pointed at him with
contempt, whispering tales in falsetto tones
to each other, which he could not understand.
But he saw by the glare of their twinkling little
eyes that they meant him, that they touched on
something in his past life.</p>

<p>By and by they became bolder and touched his
wet clothes; some of the older ones bent down to
him and whispered malicious tales about his wife
into his ears. He groaned aloud. "It is a lie!
I don't believe a word of it!" he screamed, cursing
the whole deceitful band. In his indignation
he tried to rise several times in order to drive
them away&mdash;down into the foaming stream, or
back into their mountain riff; but he could not
move; his feet seemed to be fastened to the very
ground as if paralyzed or chained to earth. They
whispered once more the name of his wife with
scornful laughter, and passed on over hills and
valleys dancing merrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a bright light shone about him,
illuminating the marshy waters; invisible choirs
were singing sweetly, as if angels were descending
from heaven. His eyes dilated as he saw a
procession of tiny elves passing him, carrying
little lighted tapers in their diminutive hands.
In their midst he saw his dear mother stretching
out her arms longingly towards him.</p>

<p>Tears came to his eyes. The dear face! He
wanted to run to her, embrace her, but could not
stir. A cry of horror broke from his trembling
lips when the fair Siren so fatal to his life stood
before him, intervening and trying to ensnare
him again with the fascination of her glittering
eyes, her bewitching smile, speaking to him of
love and devotion which he believed again.</p>

<p>He listened to her; and a ray of happiness and
delight filled his love-sick heart. She comes back
to him! She loves only him! And unheeding the
beseeching beckoning of his anxious mother,
whose tortured heart writhed and bled for her
suffering son, he hastened on with the enticing
Siren,&mdash;where to, he did not know.</p>

<p>Suddenly they stood before a deep precipice;
darkness surrounded them, and the old trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
commenced to sigh and moan and bend down upon
them. Six shadowy forms with blazing torches
appeared upon the scene carrying a coffin. Just
in front of him the lid opened and the pale waxen
face of his dead mother met his frightened eyes.
He screamed aloud with horror. He had broken
that noble heart, he had killed the best of mothers,
because he had followed this evil spirit of his life.</p>

<p>With a loud cry he threw himself upon the
lifeless form and wept, while the fair siren by his
side laughed and laughed. Beside himself with
indignation he panted, trying to strike her and
hurl words of hatred in her face; but his hands
fell helpless by his side; they had no power to
execute his will. He seemed rooted to the ground.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>V.</big></p>


<p>"Get up from this wet ground, you fellow!
How did you ever come here in this beastly
weather?" He heard a deep sympathetic voice
by his side. Awakened from his swoon, soon he
looked amazed around him. What had happened?
He did not know at all. His limbs were
helpless and he lay on the ground where he must
have fallen. His treasured source of income, his
precious book, containing all his humorous
lectures, lay rain-soaked near his side. How long
he had been lying there unconscious, he did not
know himself. A slim well-dressed man stood
before him, doing his best to help him get up
and trying to comfort him as much as he could,
shaking his head wonderingly, and inquiring how
he ever happened to be lost in such a place.</p>

<p>The lecturer looked about him with great
relief. He did not see the gnomes anywhere.
So it was not true what they told him, what they
sneered at&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>His heart rejoiced. It was only a hallucination,
nothing else. All he had seen and heard
must have been a stupid fancy of his tired brain.
The best proof was, that he found himself lying
helplessly on the ground, just awakening from a
swoon.</p>

<p>Yes, the condition of his brain was at fault;
that was as clear as daylight. "Thank God!" he
exclaimed, while a feeling of unspeakable joy
surged through his heart, now gladdened with
thankfulness.</p>

<p>"I came near believing all that stupid nonsense
of those wicked gnomes about my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey! listen to me, poor fellow! What in
Heaven's name, are you doing here on that wet
ground?"</p>

<p>It was not until the stranger by his side had
repeated his question that he could pull himself
together and answer in a stammering voice, while
a cold shiver shook his emaciated frame.</p>

<p>He looked at the stranger with dilated eyes.
"Beg pardon sir. I&mdash;I must have lost my way.
I was to give a humorous lecture at a neighboring
hotel, and&mdash;and fell down," he said helplessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
picking up his rain-soaked book, which he had
discovered within reach.</p>

<p>"Why, you are wet through and through, my
man. What can I do for you?" asked the stranger
with deep sympathy.</p>

<p>A strange look of wonder illuminated the face
of the downfallen man. He stammered: "If
you would have the great kindness to help bring
me to the Mountain View Hotel. You see, I am
expected there. I've got to earn some money
tonight yet." He paused to cough; his voice
seemed sepulchral.</p>

<p>"I have a motherless child to support." His
head was bent to hide his emotion. "My girlie
must have all she needs. I&mdash;I couldn't stand it if
they were to let her go hungry. God!" Again
a vehement cough shook his wasted frame.</p>

<p>"Well, well, this turns out all right. I'll bring
you there as we are staying in the same hotel."</p>

<p>"He's got fever, sir&mdash;better let's get him on
the box," he heard the coachman say who stood
by his side looking with obvious pity at the man
before him.</p>

<p>A few paces away, a closed carriage was standing
with two lighted lanterns in front of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm had relented for a while, and mysterious
silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Ogden!" now called out an excited woman's
voice from within the carriage. "To miss the table
d'hote on account of that wretched beggar. Why
it's just unpardonable!"</p>

<p>"That voice!... God have mercy!"</p>

<p>The man on the ground stammered as if struck by
lightning. His eyes dilated, starting out of
their sockets and staring horrified at the
carriage.</p>

<p>"That voice," he repeated. "Could it be possible?
Could she be there? Am I still under the
influence of that horrible hallucination?" he
moaned piteously. He could not and would not believe
a word of all they told him.</p>

<p>Again he seemed to hear the revolting chuckle
of the insolent gnomes, from the Traunstein, repeating
their malignant tales of the outrageous
conduct of his&mdash;</p>

<p>"Up with you quickly, for we'll have more
rain within a short time!" said Mr. Ogden, now in
a sympathetic voice, and at the same time heeding
the woman's command in the carriage, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
would not have ignored for any consideration.</p>

<p>The coachman assisted the stranger to his seat
on the box, and then Mr. Ogden entered the carriage,
closing the door carefully.</p>

<p>Then the splendid team of horses set off like
the wind. "God have pity on me! that voice!"</p>

<p>He could never forget the voice of that alluring
siren who had goaded him on, until he saw
nothing but her seductive face, listened to nothing
but her deceitful declarations of love, without
thinking of his mother's grief and her death!</p>

<p>Could it be possible? She here in that closed
carriage with another man? No, no! It was
another hallucination of his feverish brain.</p>

<p>How could she ever have attained such wealth?
"Nonsense!" he murmured smilingly to himself,
drawing a long breath of relief. Ah! how he had
adored that faithless woman!</p>

<p>The smiling expression died out of his face, and
a mournful compassion for his deserted child stole
into his troubled countenance. Why did she bring so
much misery into his life? Every fibre of his noble
heart had been throbbing with uncontrollable love
for her! And now&mdash;&mdash;the light of life, the hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
future years, was blotted out, clouds of despair
and a grim night of an unbroken desolation fell like
a pall on his heart and brain. Nothing to look
forward to but misery!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>VI.</big></p>


<p>He had wandered about like a soul condemned
and lost to eternity. But the one hope to meet
her again possessed him, kept him alive. And
then&mdash;she'll come back to him&mdash;he was convinced
of that; to his lonely little Mary. And after
all she might be touched by his devoted love
that knows how to pardon and overlook certain
occurrences in the life of a giddy-headed woman!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the cold, calculating coquette
had never felt a tinge of anything like love, and
had only an observing eye for the monthly allowances
he received from his well-to-do parents.</p>

<p>He had come to Dresden a young, inexperienced
student to pursue a course in literature and
jurisprudence. The handsome, dashing woman,
somewhere in the twenties, soon allured him with
her well tried arts. Within a short time he was
her devoted slave and did not see nor hear anything
else but her alluring voice, and after six
months' acquaintance he led her to the altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
without the knowledge of his parents.</p>

<p>When they found it out, through a friend living
in Dresden, they were in despair, in their
helpless anger. His mother never recovered
from the rude shock her ambition had received.
She did not know the woman, but when she heard
that she belonged to a different faith, she was
crushed, although the noble catholicity of spirit
that distinguished her character did not allow her
to show it. Her proudest hope to see that beloved
son some day a respected citizen and lawyer
in that little provincial town where his cradle
stood, was gone forever!</p>

<p>Years of wrestling with life's sorrows had set
upon her noble, benignant countenance, almost a
seal of holiness, and shed over her placid features
the mild, sweet life of a pure heart. Her white
hair, the snowy mass prematurely white, wonderfully
softened the outlines of her face.</p>

<p>Now deep lines commenced to furrow her
sweet, indulgent features, and she grieved so deeply
over the disgrace that she began to lose her
health. Silently, without a word to her husband
she performed her household duties, until one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
her enfeebled constitution gave way and she died,
praying for the only child she had ever had.</p>

<p>Her husband, Mr. Burge, under the double
stress of the sorrow, refused to hear anything of
the ungrateful son, for whom he had slaved and
worked all his life, and whose grievous mistake in
marrying an adventuress, had cost the mother's
life.</p>

<p>He had a large estate to look after, but he was
alone now. He needed the son, but what could he
do? He was ashamed of the daughter-in-law!
"No, not a cent of my money can she have," he
murmured constantly to himself with a flushed
face and dry lips, looking at his imposing estate,
where the beautiful Rhine rushed by and the tumbled
down castles of long-forgotten races were
seen in the distance.</p>

<p>The irate father dissolved all connection with
the son and stopped all payments, denying him
any assistance whatsoever in the future.</p>

<p>After the regular allowance from home had
entirely ceased, it was necessary for the young
husband to go and seek some profitable employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to support his expensive wife.</p>

<p>He had never earned a cent, and racked his
brain now how to get money. The tantalizing
condition pressed upon him that he might not be
able to support his family. Finally, he got a
position with a meagre salary in a newspaper
office, but he was scarcely able to provide the
barest necessaries of life.</p>

<p>He commenced to write short stories. Although
he had no ambition to climb to such a lofty
niche in the temple of fame, he thought he might
at least earn a modest income. Short stories and
humorous lectures&mdash;that must make a hit. Everybody
said that he had a humorous vein. Now the
time had come to show his mettle, but the short
stories were generally returned. The irate
father had ceased to send money and no other
help was discoverable. And then&mdash;after all
that&mdash;she, his loving wife, dropped her mask and
showed herself in her true colors.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of this," she said with a
disgusted shrug of her white shoulders to her
horrified husband. "I don't intend to starve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
here."</p>

<p>In vain he begged her to have a little patience
for the sake of their child. The last short story
must turn out to be a great success; he felt it and
was really convinced of it.</p>

<p>"Convinced," she sneered contemptuously
and turned away. No use of losing any breath
about it, she thought. I am through with him
anyway. Oh! How she longed to be rich, wear
stylish clothes and be admired.</p>

<p>The beautiful coquette became restless in her
little home; she looked about sick at heart, unable
to tolerate it any longer, only wishing to get the
opportunity to leave it forever. Her eyes were full
of scorn when looking at her husband, who could
not supply her with all that she longed for just
now, and for which she would have pledged the
salvation of her very soul. She commenced to
frequent public places in the absence of her husband.</p>

<p>How she loathed poverty! "Anything but
that," she murmured to herself, her face white
with disgust as she walked on, gazing in all
directions to see one of her former acquaintances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with a strange unrest in her large eyes. Her
opportunity would come; she was sure of that, and
it came in meeting one day the rich Englishman
who was introduced to her by one of her former
friends and boon companions.</p>

<p>Shortly after this encounter, she received a
letter from the Englishman telling her of the deep
and lasting impression she had made on him and
how he longed to see her again. Her face flushed
with pleasure as she read all these, and then
perused an invitation to take an automobile ride
through the beautiful mountains.</p>

<p>For some time she sat dazzled, and then she
looked at the poorly furnished rooms; at her own
wretched outfit, and her eyes flashed indignantly.</p>

<p>"I am through with all this. Here is the
opportunity I was longing for," she said with a
contemptuous smile. "I'll show him&mdash;the young
inexperienced fool I have married&mdash;that beauty
counts for a whole lot and ... boldness even
more."</p>

<p>She stopped at the window and looked down
at the Englishman's automobile before her door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"The opportunity&mdash;my opportunity has come."
These words rang ceaselessly in her ears and
filled her being with a strange endeavor to
avenge herself on the man who could not supply
her with all the luxuries she craved for, and
according to her ethics, was entitled to.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>VII.</big></p>


<p>It was on Christmas eve, her husband had
come home with a radiant face. His short story
had been accepted, and the money was in his
pocket. Now he could buy a fitting present for
his wife. Of course it could not be too expensive,
but she certainly would enjoy it all the same;
he was sure of that, feeling that the opening of a
successful career was inaugurated.</p>

<p>On his way home he had also bought a little fir
tree to set up for the first Christmas celebration
in his own home. The recollections of similar
holidays in the house of his parents stirred him
to the depths. How his heart quivered when he
thought of his dear mother he loved so dearly.
If she only were alive how different everything
would be! He, who was brought up in luxury,
mother's pet, and now&mdash;</p>

<p>With deep emotion he entered the house. With a
brisk step he opened the door, looked around and
found it empty, the wife and all her belongings
gone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The horror of that night was something he
could never forget as long as he lived. Holding
his ten months' old child in his trembling arms,
he wept burning tears for her, the mother of his
child. Could it be possible? A mother deserting
her child on this holiest of evenings? He
could not believe his eyes, but all she possessed
went with her. No, no, she was giddy-headed,
but not cruel. Motherhood must assert itself
and surely would. How he loved her, how he
longed to take her in his arms and feed his poor,
famished heart with a touch of her lips!</p>

<p>He sat there in the dark listening and waiting
for her to come back, to see the presents he had
bought for her, and the money he wanted to give
her. But one hour after another passed and nobody
came. In the streets a joyous throng of merry
makers pushed and jostled about wishing each
other a merry Christmas. His heart was shaken
to its depths by maddening grief; by bitter
disappointment.</p>

<p>The room was icy cold, there was no fire in
the stove, and the child half starved, screamed
weakly in his arms. In wild desperation he
trampled on the little Christmas tree he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
brought along to celebrate his first Christmas
in his own home! He could see nothing but
falsehood and treachery in this world. What
meaning was there for him in this life-redeeming
symbol?</p>

<p>Sick of everything he longed for death to
come and take him and his little child away.
Throughout that dreary night of agony he lay
in bed holding the child in his arms, pressing his
lips against her tender little hands, without
being able to close an eye.</p>

<p>The bell in the neighboring churches rang out
in the ears of the deserted man, sounding dismally
through his lonely house. But they brought
back pictures to his mind of his childhood's
happy days, when he went to church on
similar Christmas eves with his parents. One
tear after another stole into his desperate eyes.</p>

<p>"God have mercy on me and my child," he
murmured stammeringly. "I must, I will live for
her sake. I cannot leave her altogether an orphan,"
though the gaping wound in his own heart
kept on bleeding, bleeding incessantly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>VIII.</big></p>


<p>"There! Here we are at last, no weather for
a dog to be out," growled the angry coachman
sulkily, jumping down from the box and opening
the carriage door with a respectful bow, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden staggered quickly out and lifted
tenderly and carefully a woman's form to the wet
ground. Young Burge, the deserted husband,
had just come down with the help of the coachman
who growled something he could not understand.</p>

<p>He looked at the woman in the darkness and
a mist swam before his eyes; he leaned against
the coach and his knees shook so that he could
not make a single step. The night was black and
the wind sobbed down the street, while the rain
still fell in torrents.</p>

<p>He could not see clearly&mdash;but that voice&mdash;that
voice! God! "Could they have been right&mdash;these
wicked, malicious gnomes? Did they know all
about her and now, how?" he asked himself while
his hands clutched the book convulsively in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
helpless agony.</p>

<p>He thought he heard them again whispering,
with a derisive chuckle, the whole story of her
downfall into his terrified ears.</p>

<p>"How could she ever come to such magnificent
clothes?" he thought. "Nonsense! It is simply
a hallucination of a morbid, disordered brain.
I am sick and miserable and see things where
there is nothing to see." This he murmured
half aloud to himself, gazing at the retreating
form of the woman incredulously. He could not
distinguish her features and he made up his mind
forcibly, in order to quiet down his excited nerves,
that it was nothing else but a foolish trick of his
imagination, and the fever which shook him now
again was the obvious cause of it all. "Anyway,
how could she have obtained all this luxurious
outfit? His wife wealthy? Nonsense!"</p>

<p>He tried to laugh cheerfully about this foolishness,
but suddenly he felt as though a knife were
plunged into his heart. "The gnomes! the
gnomes! If that which they had said were true!"
He moaned to himself, leaning against the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
in a faint condition. "Oh, anything but that ...
anything but that!" His whole frame shook as
from palsy. That voice haunted him. He knew
he had to go and look at her in order to convince
himself, otherwise he could not find any rest.</p>

<p>"Come, come! You must not lose your courage,
my good fellow," said Mr. Ogden good-naturedly,
coming out of the house at the same
time. "But before you do anything else, you
should go inside and get those wet clothes off;
yes, that you must do, my man, you look pale
enough indeed, and...."</p>

<p>"The deuce! If that is not our expected entertainer,
the humorous lecturer from Ishle!" cried the
stout, dignified hotelier, with a laugh as he
caught sight of the dripping form of the poor,
dazed lecturer.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a state he is in! Why he isn't
able to lecture!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, a hot grog, some dry clothes
from my wardrobe, and the rest will soon be managed,"
said Mr. Ogden good-naturedly with a sign to his
valet, greatly gratified in being able to help the
poor, miserable looking man with the pallor of
death on his emaciated face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"And as for your entertainment being a great
success, well&mdash;leave that to me, my dear fellow
and don't worry; it will be all right," he went on,
clapping the dazed humorist on the shoulder with
an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>He bowed, without being able to utter a word
of thanks; he bit his trembling lips and followed
the valet with stumbling, shivering feet.</p>

<p>"Who could this benevolent stranger be?
And what was he to that woman? Was he mistaken
or not? If, after all she should be his&mdash;his&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hot wave flushed his face, distorted with
shame as he thought of the possibility; his sorely
tried heart was hammering mightily within him.</p>

<p>He could not get rid of this thought. "If she
should really be the mother of his poor child
... what, in the name of Heaven, was she
then to this man? God have mercy on me and
come to my aid!" he cried aloud, in great misery,
his teeth once more chattering audibly in a fresh
attack. "No, no! I can't and won't believe it!
She can't be so shameless as to disgrace me and
her innocent child!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come quickly, sir," urged the valet
impatiently, "I'll help you as much as I can."</p>

<p>After he had provided him with all the necessary
clothes from the elaborately assorted wardrobe
of the rich Englishman, who was about the
same size, he made as careful a toilet as possible,
under the prevailing circumstances and under the
careful inspection of the helpful valet.</p>

<p>The supper bell now rang through the vast
corridors of the Mountain View Hotel, crowded
with tourists from all parts of the continent.
Ladies, gorgeously dressed, commenced to take
their seats at the supper tables in the dining
room, escorted by elegantly garbed gentlemen;
some of them in full evening dress, others
again in black cutaway. The clatter of knives
and forks had already begun. The spacious
dining room was brightly illuminated. At the
further end a carpet-covered platform was
visible, whose edges were a bank of flowers.
Everything was tastefully arranged. A pianist
was already hammering away at a waltz of one
of the latest operatic successes, with
frightful execution, as an introduction to
the interesting program of the evening,
anxiously awaited by the patrons of the house.</p>

<p>The clatter, the bustling noise, had suddenly
stopped and all eyes were riveted expectantly on
the man who had just entered. Our humorist,
suffering in mind and body alike, pale and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
haggard, with restless eyes, made his appearance
in the borrowed clothes which hung loosely about
his emaciated form, tossing back his long locks
with his right hand, while holding the cherished
book tightly in the other, he came down to the
very edge of the platform and smiled and bowed
in all directions.</p>

<p>He looked exhausted and weary, as he was.
But the room was crowded and he had to go on,
whether he wanted or not, so he commenced:
"Ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>He got no further. A mist swam suddenly
before his eyes. A shiver shook his emaciated
frame, his face became flushed and bloated and
he stared and stared.</p>

<p>A side door had been opened a few minutes
before and Mr. Ogden entered with the much
admired Cleopatra on his arm.</p>

<p>They passed through the crowded dining room,
close to the speaker's platform. She had changed
her dazzling costume for a simpler, but an extremely
stylish dress of blue silk. She still wore
some of the lilies in the marvelous golden hair,
which was now fastened with a gold comb into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
plain Greek knot. She was all aglow with
excitement. The triumph of the afternoon was still
lingering on her handsome face. She felt like
shouting it out to everybody. Such conquest does
not come often to a woman in the ordinary walks
of life.</p>

<p>She walked proudly, with a queenly step to her
seat, nodding to some casual acquaintances with
a charming smile. And then she took her seat
and turned a glance of curiosity upon the famished
face of the entertainer. Their eyes met&mdash;and for
a few seconds sank into each others' like sharp
daggers. A red tinge covered her startled face,
then she turned away, whiter than the lilies on her
breast. She trembled visibly and looked frightened,
casting down her eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden did not seem to have noticed any
change in her appearance and gazed with a shocked
countenance and great pity at the reduced exterior
of the poor humorist. Suddenly a great
excitement was noticeable among all the guests
sitting around the small tables. Several gentlemen
had left their seats, rushed towards the place
where the poor entertainer had collapsed after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
recognizing his faithless wife garbed in that
splendor, so shamefully acquired, of which the
wicked gnomes were whispering so constantly into
his ears.</p>

<p>He still believed in her then; but now&mdash;the
dark, threatening expression in his livid face was
frightful to behold. He murmured something
about the gnomes that nobody could understand,
staring with hatred in his dilated eyes in the
direction where she sat&mdash;she, the mother of his
innocent child, now disgraced forever!</p>

<p>"God! What have I done to deserve such a
punishment?" he murmured once more, pressing
his bloodless lips tightly together as a cold
perspiration broke out on his deathlike face.</p>

<p>A vision of his mother's warning and sorrows
was presented to his benighted intelligence and
made him cry with terror and shame. The conflicting
emotions were too much for the sadly undermined
constitution.</p>

<p>"The wicked gnomes!" he whispered with audible
scorn and contempt in his blazing eyes, as
if sudden madness had seized on him, and then
tried to curse her, but not another word escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his tightly closed lips, though the blood began
to gush from them.</p>

<p>The truth, so cruelly thrust upon him, ended
his life's drama; his eyes closed, he fell in
a heap to the floor.</p>

<p>The pitying guests stood helplessly around
him and did not know what to do. Mr. Ogden was
the first one who had presence of mind to send to
the nearest village in search of a doctor.</p>

<p>The beautiful Cleopatra sat there as pale as
a ghost and was afraid to go near the prostrate
form of her unhappy husband, fearing that someone
might lift the veil and show the audience the
ugliness of her real self. A feeling of
restlessness rushed upon her as if the shameful
story were being written on her flushed face.
She could not endure it any longer and left the
dining room.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden did not notice her departure, and
busied himself around the dying man, asking what
he could do for him. The poor man pointed to a
letter in his side pocket where the addresses of
his friends in Dresden were written down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"The gnomes! ... the gnomes!" he stammered
once more as the shadow of death began to
close in upon him. The blood streamed out
incessantly, and before the aid of a doctor
could be secured, he was a corpse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>XI.</big></p>


<p>Mr. Ogden, deeply moved, went to his rooms.</p>

<p>She, the cause of it all, sat at the window with
a book in her hands without reading it. There
was a look in the woman's face that amazed him,
a hard, cold look, that he had never seen there
before while the sunbeams fell on her bewitching
features and on the green leaves still in her hair.</p>

<p>"I want to leave the place at once," she said
without looking at him.</p>

<p>"That poor man's face seems to haunt you,
dear tender-hearted girlie," he replied with an
outburst of tenderness, taking her in his arms and
kissing the handsome face he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing that he was blissfully
ignorant of her relation to the dead man.</p>

<p>Gathering up courage&mdash;seeing that no suspicion
had entered his mind&mdash;she raised her beautiful
eyes to his languidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, dear, I cannot stand such
horrible things ... it shocks me," she answered
with her accustomed dissimulation in tone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
action.</p>

<p>Although she was a great adept in the art of
hypocrisy and dissimulation, she could not
altogether hide the uneasiness which had taken
possession of her. A strange expression came into
her eyes, an expression he had never seen there.
He looked at her and was puzzled. What was it?
What brought the change about? He could not
tell.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly and looked out of the
window with a stony face, in order to hide, to
subdue,&mdash;what? Did she conjure up a sinful vision
of her own life? No, she would not give in, but
she was startled to perceive something within her
she did not reckon with: a voice wanted to be
heard, no matter how hard she tried to subdue it.
It was the voice of motherhood&mdash;that feeling
seemed to be not quite dead in the heart of the
shameless woman. It was Nature's revenge!
She had to listen to the voice of Nature, or was
it conscience, slowly awakening to life?</p>

<p>Ah! Who would or could fathom the heart of
an unscrupulous coquette?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Had he any family?" she asked, indifferently,
avoiding his inquisitive gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he has a child, here is the address,"
he replied. "I think it must be with someone
he knew, poor unfortunate man. And he gave
me this in order to look up his orphan child."
A mournful compassion soon stole into his eyes.</p>

<p>"He could not speak any more, but the pitiful
glance of the dying man's face told me as much,
and I am going to Dresden and see whether I can
do anything for his child," he added, looking
deeply moved out of the window. She gazed at him
with puzzled eyes. "God! if he had an inkling
whose child that is!" she thought, remorsefully
recoiling a step with downcast eyes and tightened
lips.</p>

<p>Finally summoning up courage enough, she
said, hesitatingly, as if fearing any comment:</p>

<p>"Yes, ... let us stop there on our way
to Switzerland."</p>

<p>He wanted to stay until the funeral of the poor
lecturer was over, but she would not hear of it.
She looked at him with frightened eyes when he
made the suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot stand such scenes," she replied with
quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Then we'll go, my sensitive little
girlie. That accident seemed to have upset your
nervous system," he said with a smile, kissing her
tenderly and gazing fondly at her troubled face.</p>

<p>On the following morning they took their departure
for Dresden, leaving some money for the
funeral expenses in the hands of the hotel keeper.</p>

<p>Instinctively he felt like doing something for
the man he had robbed of his happiness without
knowing it.</p>

<p>But the unscrupulous coquette loved nobody but
herself, knew it, felt it, though without any
remorse, that she had betrayed his deep devotion
and undying love so shamefully, fearing, in her
deceitfulness, only one thing&mdash;detection.</p>

<p>The following day a simple hearse, containing
the corpse of the poor humorist whose life ended
so tragically, went up a lonely hill where the
grave diggers had just finished their gloomy work.
The coffin was lowered and the grave covered with
mother earth. No mourners stood around shedding
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The song of a mocking-bird rang from the
downy cradle of myrtle blossoms&mdash;as a funeral
dirge&mdash;and a whip-poor-will answered from a
cedar in the neighboring woods.</p>

<p>When the night train going to Dresden, rushed
by, the little white cross indicating his resting
place, looked like a bleached hand of a skeleton
shining out with a ghostly radiance across the
silent, gloomy plain.</p>

<p>Through the fleecy vapors floating around the
lonely hill one with clairvoyant eye may see at
midnights the vacillating horde of the tiny gnomes
from the Traunstein with downcast torches repeating
whisperingly the sad tale, and pointing
at the grave, in which the body of the dead humorist,
betrayed of his life's happiness, crumbles to
dust.</p>

<h2>THE ARTIST</h2>




<p class="center"><big>I.</big></p>


<p>The eye of the attentive observer who wanders
through Fifth Avenue, and the streets which
run into it from right and left, is especially
attracted by the houses, built here in the Colonial,
there in the Renaissance style. Some of these
imposing edifices (often the only reminder of
long-vanished fortunes), with their rich facades,
afford a striking criterion of the tastes of their
builders and of their former inhabitants.</p>

<p>In one of these houses, rearing their proud
height to the sky, a small lap-dog, bedecked with
silken ribbons, sat in a parlor window. He stretched
his snowy paws with great satisfaction on the
cushioned window-seat, warming himself in the
April sun. The luxurious room behind him was
quite empty, and the enforced solitude was not
at all to the taste of the spoiled pet. It was
probably for this reason that he did not find it
worth his while to bark in a superior manner at the
pedestrians who appeared on the street, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
look of silent contempt told very plainly that he
had made up his mind to consider as extremely
unpleasing the movements of a limping
street-cleaner who was at the moment just in front
of the house.</p>

<p>In fact, the lame man did not look as if he
could pretend being favored with a condescending
glance by a lap-dog living amidst such sumptuous
surroundings.</p>

<p>He looked, too, as if he had had no great practice
at his wretched calling&mdash;as if he were a novice
at it. Although his sickly, sunken features were
surrounded by an unkempt grey beard, and his
clothing hung loosely about his wasted form, he
somehow gave the impression of being an intelligent
man of some education, upon whom undeserved
misfortune pressed heavily.</p>

<p>The well-fed pet in the parlor window, however,
had no conception of undeserved misery, and
was about casting to the winds the carefully drilled
manners of an educated dog when, fortunately,
a well-appointed carriage drew up just as the
lame man was preparing to go on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>A delicate-looking lady with a kindly face
alighted from the carriage, and nodded smilingly
to the little dog. The lame street-cleaner had no
sooner glanced at the benevolent face of the
richly-dressed woman than his emaciated form began
to tremble. His face, so pale before, became red,
as with humiliation, and in a state of marked
agitation he was on the point of dropping his
broom and stealing quietly away.</p>

<p>The lady, Mrs. Denison, who had just come
from a charitable gathering, and was still under
the influence of her charitable mood, felt hurriedly
in her purse for a silver-piece, which she instructed
her servant to give the lame man as she ascended
the broad steps and disappeared into the house.</p>

<p>"I am no beggar!" stammered the street-cleaner
in broken English, waving off the proffered
alms with a trembling hand.</p>

<p>Within the mansion Mr. Denison, in a faultless
evening costume, turned the diamond sleeve-links
in the cuffs he was adjusting as he awaited his
wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Denison laid aside her hat and cloak
and hastened upstairs to greet him, beginning at
once to give him a rather feverish account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
doings of the association of which she was president.</p>

<p>Presently another turn was given to the conversation
by the entrance of a tall young man with
light blue eyes and a rather inexpressive face.</p>

<p>"I am done with racing for the present!" he
cried eagerly, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" answered Mrs. Denison, fervently.</p>

<p>"Eh, for once, George," said Mr. Denison
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And do you know why? My favorite won
first place&mdash;only think how lucky!" The young
man's excitement was perceptible in his panting
breath.</p>

<p>"And how delighted Lucy will be! Here she
comes now," said Mrs. Denison, turning to kiss
the white forehead of her daughter as she entered
the room.</p>

<p>Lucy, a pale, thoughtful girl, with large, meditative
eyes shaded by gold-rimmed glasses, held
out her finely-shaped hand to George Elmore with
a forced smile. There was, indeed, very little of
the delight of which her mother had spoken to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
seen in her face, although the young man scarcely
seemed to notice its absence. Various sports
occupied him to such an extent that he never had
time to make a study of the girl to whom he was
engaged. In addition to his penchant for amusements
of the most superficial kind, the gift of
observation was entirely lacking in his inflated
brain. It was generally supposed that he was
very much in love with her, but it was a question
whether his affection for his riding-horse was not
of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Any one who did observe the pale face of the
young girl more closely, however, could not have
failed to notice the light quivering of her
finely-chiselled nostrils, the nervous motion of
her red lips.</p>

<p>In spite of the assumed appearance of calm,
which proved the power of her will, it was possible
to perceive the existence within her of some
deep emotion.</p>

<p>She was standing by the window, the involuntary
witness of the alms giving when it had occurred.
The lame man in the street was no stranger
to her; she knew his domestic circumstances only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
too well, and during his stay in the hospital
had helped to support his family without confiding
the circumstance to her parents. Whether she
had omitted to mention it for fear of making
herself ridiculous, or from some deeper motive,
perhaps she, herself, could not at the present
moment have determined.</p>

<p>Lucy breathed a sigh of relief when the dinner
was announced, and her <i>fiance</i> went away to
carry his pleasant news to other friends and
acquaintances.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the poor cripple hobbled off to his
miserable dwelling. With failing breath he
dragged himself over the great distance which
lay between him and the lower part of the city,
without once raising his eyes from the pavement,
suffering and devastating mental torture showing
in the feverish glow of his sunken eyes.</p>

<p class="center"><big>II.</big></p>


<p>Martin, the lame man, had been brought from Lyons
by Mr. Denison, the silk manufacturer, apparently
under the most favorable conditions. In the silk
factory in New Jersey he had proven himself a most
skillful dyer. The Denison wares came to be noted
for their likeness to the Lyonese goods, and in a
short time, through their similarity to the imported
ones, surpassed all that had hitherto been made on
this side of the ocean. For this reason the goddess,
Fortune, added continually to the Denison stock of
worldly treasures.</p>

<p>But the continued pressure of the long workdays
began to call forth loud remonstrances from
the workmen in the Denison factory. Martin,
generally looked upon as being responsible for the
improvement in the product, was, consequently,
hated as being the indirect cause of that pressure.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned if I work a day longer for
such beggarly wages!" cried a red-headed Irishman
one day, bringing his fist down on the dye-tub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
with an angry look.</p>

<p>"I can't blame him; he's in the right of it!"
answered a second workman.</p>

<p>"A twelve-hour day, and such hard work at
that!" cried a third one, leaving his work-bench.</p>

<p>"Right you are!" exclaimed all the others,
rolling up their sleeves aggressively.</p>

<p>"If the boss doesn't give us an eight-hour day
and higher wages, we quit tomorrow, eh, boys?"
cried the angry Irishman, his nose turning from
red to purple in his excitement.</p>

<p>Martin had been endeavoring, with ever-increasing
earnestness, to calm the excited minds of the
workmen, but all that he had been able to say to
this end had been laughed to scorn. The next
morning he was the only one who appeared at the
factory.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock came a deputation of the employees
to the office of the manufacturer. Mr. Denison was
perfectly willing to agree to a raise in wages,
but he would hear nothing of an eight-hour
workday, even at the risk of having to stop
work for an indefinite period. Orders were coming
in day by day. The busy season had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
opened and the shutting down of the works would
have meant a considerable loss to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Martin received orders to engage
new workmen at once and set them going at their
different tasks. The strikers no sooner became
aware of this than they began to cast angry
glances at Martin.</p>

<p>"Our places to be taken by others?" cried the
red-headed Irishman to Martin, in a voice choked
with rage, as the latter, weary and worn, prepared
to take his way homeward.</p>

<p>"The dog of a foreigner is to blame for it all!"
said another with threatening gestures.</p>

<p>This was the beginning. The whole of the
brutal crew fell upon Martin, and soon left him
lying senseless on the ground. In this state he
was carried home. His wife, an intelligent woman,
the daughter of a doctor in Basle, and his four
children, wept loudly, as the beloved father was
carried unconscious into the house. The help of a
physician was soon at hand and after a thorough
examination a fracture was discovered in the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
part of the right thigh.</p>

<p>The poor wife tended her unfortunate husband
with the entire self-sacrifice of a true woman,
keeping up the house as long as possible with
what little money she could painfully scrape together.</p>

<p>The eldest son, a youth of twenty-four, who,
having regard to his manifest talent, had educated
himself to be a painter, was unfortunately unable
to find employment just at this time, in spite of
his diligent and anxious search for it. To the serious
financial situation was added the bitter recognition
of the fact that the condition of the beloved
sufferer was daily growing worse.</p>

<p>Despair seized the unhappy family. The head
of the firm was the only person from whom they
might expect help. Accordingly Mrs. Martin decided
to go to him as soon as possible, since the
factory was to be closed for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>Shyly and hesitatingly she entered the office.
The thought of having to confess her dire poverty
brought a flood of red to her thin face. No one
was in the office but a clerk. To the question as
to whether she could see Mr. Denison he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with a contemptuous laugh that Mr. Denison had
more important business on hand that day, and
was visible to no one. Her urgent entreaty to be
allowed to see him if only for a moment was in
vain. The clerk rudely showed her the door.</p>

<p>During this conversation, Lucy, the recently
betrothed daughter of the manufacturer, sat listening
in an adjoining room. The continued disturbances
at the factory had caused her so much anxiety that
she had insisted upon accompanying her father to
the works, which she had scarcely visited before
since her return from Germany. She had studied for
two years at a school in Leipzig, and through the
intellectual treasures of German literature and art
she had become conversant with nobler pleasures
than those which proved so attractive to Mr. Elmore,
her <i>fiance</i>. Her aspirations for high and
beautiful ideals found rich satisfaction in the
finer and more artistic pursuits.</p>

<p>She was sitting thoughtfully by the window,
looking out at the grey clouds that chased each
other across the sky like a troop of headless
ghosts. Her profile was, perhaps, lacking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
classic lines which esthetic laws prescribe for
beauty; but a rich spiritual life gave an
indescribable charm to her pale countenance.</p>

<p>Her large, meditative eyes seemed shadowed
today by a deep melancholy. However she tried
to fix her thoughts on George Elmore, the companion
of her childhood, to whom, at her parents'
wish she had engaged herself, today she found it
impossible. Always there arose from the depths
of her memory the face of a shy, gentle youth
with light, curling hair and deep searching eyes,
and the vision made her tremble.</p>

<p>Chance had made them acquainted at the Art
School. She had been trying, unsuccessfully, to
reproduce the luminous expression of a saint. Her
neighbor, watching her conflict with her difficult
task, showed, in his shy fashion, his willingness
to be of use to her. With a few strokes of his
brush he succeeded in catching the desired
expression, and at the same time gave her in a
hesitating voice an explanation of the picture,
and its purpose. He spoke of the light effects which
he considered an erroneous conception on the part of
the painter, while the next picture, belonging in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
part to the school of Rembrandt, reached a happier
effect from the depths of the shadows in one
place and the heightening of the light in another.</p>

<p>From that time on they worked for hours side
by side, he explaining the lights and shadows of
each picture with such fullness of comprehension,
such a thorough knowledge of history, literature,
and art, as to make a deep impression on her mind.
Her two years' sojourn in Germany had not been
able to efface these art-school recollections. She
did not know his name, to say nothing of his social
position and still&mdash;she could not forget&mdash;even
now she thought of him&mdash;even now his picture
thrust itself between her and her <i>fiance</i>.</p>

<p>Involuntarily she sprang to her feet to escape
those torturing thoughts. Her attention was
caught by the sound of low sobbing. She was able
to observe through a crack in the partition the
distress of poor Mrs. Martin, as the clerk refused
her admittance into the manufacturer's private
office.</p>

<p>Broken with discouragement and suffering,
Mrs. Martin had scarcely closed the door behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
her when Lucy entered the office.</p>

<p>"Who is that sobbing woman?" she asked hastily
of the clerk.</p>

<p>"That woman? She is the wife of the former
foreman, whom&mdash;the strikers&mdash;handled somewhat
roughly," he answered, hesitatingly, dropping
his malicious eyes.</p>

<p>"She wished to speak to papa, didn't she?
Why didn't you let her in?" she demanded, frowning.</p>

<p>"Because I had strict orders not to let anyone
in today," he replied shortly, suppressing his
rebellious feelings.</p>

<p>"Then I must hurry after the poor woman and
ask her if there is anything I can do for her,"
murmured Lucy with quick decision, taking up
her hat and cape from an adjoining room.</p>

<p>"I suppose the distinguished Mr. Martin's
last dollar's gone," sneered the clerk after her
in an Irish accent.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>III.</big></p>


<p>Lucy hastened after Mrs. Martin, who was still
visible in the distance. As the deeply tried woman
closed the door of her modest dwelling, a light
step made her turn and open it again. She gazed
with surprise into the face of the elegantly-gowned
girl with the gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Martin live here?" the girl inquired
in a doubtful voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you be so good as to walk in?"
answered the astonished woman. And then with
a glance into the room&mdash;"Eugene, a lady!" she
called to her son.</p>

<p>An inner door opened and Eugene Martin appeared.
They stood speechless, gazing in confusion
at each other, while white and red chased each
other over both of their faces. It was perfectly
obvious that they were not strangers to each other;
indeed, they had often painted side by side at the
Art School. It was the same shy, gentle youth
with the dark speaking eyes who had occupied
more of her thoughts than would have been considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
advisable for an engaged girl. Nevertheless she
struggled to conceal her excitement, and to
appear calmly in the character of the purpose
which had brought her. But how could she offer
alms to this family? No, it would no longer be
possible; her sensibilities revolted at this thought,
and for the moment she wished even to conceal
her name from them.</p>

<p>"I wished to have a picture of my&mdash;" she was
about to say, "of my <i>fiance</i>," without really
thinking of him in the least, but a flame of red
overspread her face and the word died upon her lips.
"&mdash;of myself," she substituted. "And I wish it
done in oils," she went on in a firmer tone.</p>

<p>Eugene conducted the visitor to the scrupulously
clean, though modest, little parlor. In order
to reach it they were obliged to pass through
the room where his father lay ill, the wild fancies
of fever playing antics in his brain. Lucy threw
a glance of deep sympathy at the sufferer, visibly
moved at the sight of his hollow, ashen face.</p>

<p>The great interest she displayed and the anxious
inquiries she made about his father's illness,
filled Eugene's heart with gratitude. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
have knelt before this being from another sphere,
to whom he had scarcely dared to raise his eyes,
and thank her in that humble way of his for the
warm sympathy she bestowed on his sick father.</p>

<p>"I have seen some of your paintings, and&mdash;I
am quite sure that my portrait will be a success&mdash;"
began Lucy, stammering again, as she
looked at the sketches displayed about the room.</p>

<p>"I should, of course, do my best&mdash;to&mdash;keep
your good opinion of my capability," answered
Eugene, with downcast eyes and a hesitating
tongue.</p>

<p>Lucy had taken up a portfolio and was turning
over its contents, simply to avoid having to
meet his glances. She was afraid he might read
what was passing in her mind.</p>

<p>"But whether I should be able to satisfy a lady
who has so much artistic knowledge&mdash;I hardly
know," he admitted modestly, "for of late I have
not been able to do much except this landscape."</p>

<p>He indicated a picture which hung at the other
end of the room, wondering at the flush which had
overspread Lucy's face as she bent over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
portfolio, her blood tingling to her finger's ends.</p>

<p>She put down the treacherous portfolio hastily.
The exposition of the secret hidden within its
covers made her tremble. One of her own drawings,
which she had probably thrown away, suddenly
met her eyes. It had been enriched by a border
of blue forget-me-nots, and as she drew it forth
from one of the side pockets she saw, underneath
it, written in Eugene's hand, the single
word: "Unforgetable."</p>

<p>Her heart beat loudly; still she retained
self-command enough to ask in an indifferent tone,
when he would be ready to begin the sketch for the
portrait, at the same time examining the picture
to which he had drawn her attention.</p>

<p>"I should like to know, also, what your price
is to be for the execution of the picture," she said,
raising her eyes timidly.</p>

<p>He would have been glad to avoid any mentioning
of the question of money, but when she insisted,
in a hesitating voice, he named a small amount.</p>

<p>"I believe it is customary to pay half in advance,"
Lucy went on with an embarrassed smile, handing a
fifty-dollar note to the confused Eugene, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of his shy protest that he was not in the least
hurry about it.</p>

<p>After the day and hour had been fixed for the
first sketch of the portrait, Lucy returned to the
factory deeply gratified that she had found a way
to help the poor woman in her distress. Her
father, immersed in business, had scarcely noticed
her absence. She would have liked to tell him
something of the poverty and illness of his old
foreman, but an indefinable feeling of shyness
kept her silent. The factory was closed on the
same day.</p>

<p>Poor Martin's condition grew visibly worse.
On the doctor's recommendation, he was transferred
to the neighboring hospital, and the afflicted
family reconciled themselves to the inevitable.
Although the poor wife had tended him day and
night with never-varying devotion, she could not
but admit that she was not in a position to give
him all that was required by the physician's
directions.</p>

<p>Eugene, now the only support of the family,
was obliged, in default of anything better, to
take to retouching pictures for photographers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
This ill-paid mechanical labor was beginning to
have an injurious effect upon his imagination. The
day-dreams which had filled his whole soul,
anticipating his going to the Eternal City, to
receive there the artist's consecration by studying
the great masterpieces, he now saw vanishing into
comfortless vacuity, replaced by nothing better
than the dreamy monotony of earning his daily
bread by hard and uninteresting work.</p>

<p>Lucy's meteoric appearance, however, had
filled the darkened spirit of the young man with
a cheering light. With fiery eagerness he began
sketching the dear face which he had never been
able to forget. The laboring mechanic disappeared,
and the artist, once more awakened, felt his
genius glow again with the desire to create. This
girl, the very sight of whom made him tremble
with joy, must not be allowed to lose her faith
in his talent&mdash;his artistic capacity. In her eyes
he wished to be that, which his dreams had promised
he should be&mdash;a real artist, even if he were
obliged to strain his powers to the very limit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the unattainable.</p>

<p>At the appointed hours Lucy came, bringing,
like Schiller's 'Maiden from a foreign shore,'
valuable gifts for his mother, with fruits and
toys for the children. To Eugene, however, she
brought the most fatal gift&mdash;a ray of that
unsurpassable bitter-sweet pain which men call love,
and which often ends only with life. After she had
left the house all trace of her vanished; none of
them knew whence she came or whither she went.</p>

<p>With each sitting Eugene grew into a condition
of more blissful intoxication, although Lucy,
in her refined unapproachableness, gave him not
the slightest excuse for such a feeling. Only once
he felt her thoughtful eyes resting upon him with
an expression which sent the blood coursing madly
through his veins.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>IV.</big></p>


<p>One day when the picture was almost completed
he received the following lines from her:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am going with my mother to Palm
Beach, where we expect to spend a month
or two. If my portrait is done before I
come back, kindly send it to No. &mdash; Fifth
Avenue. Remember me to your dear
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 94%;">LUCY."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A check was enclosed for the balance of the
stipulated price.</p>

<p>Eugene felt an icy breath sweep over the glowing
love which filled his heart, like the freezing
north wind which brings death and destruction
in its train, blowing over land and sea and carrying
all before it. His artistic powers to strive
for the heights of ideals seemed broken; he had no
energy left. All was dark and gloomy within
him.</p>

<p>"She is rich and I&mdash;oh, so poor!" was the
thought incessantly in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>In his present position as sole support of his
family he could not long give himself up to such
unfruitful emotions; he must work in order to
provide bread for his mother and the children.
And so he tried by hard, incessant labor, by
constant occupation, to forget the sweet dream of
his brief, imaginary happiness. A bitter feeling
of depression rose in him at the thought that the
richly-dressed lady must consider him a fool,
puffed up with artistic pride; that she thought
of him, if at all, with a pitying smile at his
presumption.</p>

<p>Thanks to the skillful medical care which Martin
shared at the hospital, he was soon on the road
to recovery.</p>

<p>"You will have to get used to the idea of having
a lame husband the rest of your life," he would
say smilingly to his wife, who visited him daily.</p>

<p>"If only your love isn't lame, we shall be all
right again," she answered him with simple affection.
He wiped away an unobserved tear, and pressed her
hand with emotion.</p>

<p>Eugene grew pale and nervous. Seeking forgetfulness
in his work he labored day and night with unwearying
diligence, allowing himself no time for rest. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
brief pauses he was obliged to make it obvious, however,
that he had not entirely succeeded. Something of pain,
of untold suffering, would then steal over his weary
face. The nervous strain, continued for weeks, together
with the hardly repressed mental conflict, began, little
by little, to undermine his constitution, never of the
strongest.</p>

<p>It was just a week after his father had left the
hospital (with one leg shorter than the other but
otherwise in good health) that Eugene fell fainting
at his work. In a day or two a severe nervous
fever developed. His parents, horribly frightened,
did all in their power to aid his recovery.</p>

<p>Martin, though still weak, made haste to hobble
to the factory, which, on the termination of
the strike had opened as usual, to try for his former
position.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Denison here?" he asked of the book-keeper,
who was a stranger to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Denison has gone to Florida&mdash;the date
of his return is uncertain," answered the
book-keeper, returning to his interrupted occupation
without paying any more attention to the white-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
cripple who stood leaning against the desk.</p>

<p>"My name is Martin, and I used to be in
charge of the dyeing department here," persisted
the anxious applicant, resolved not to be dismissed
so easily.</p>

<p>"Every place is filled now, and well filled,"
said the book-keeper with a trace of irritation, not
looking up from his big ledger; "and anyhow,
you may be quite sure there will be no change in
the staff as long as the boss is away."</p>

<p>Crushed and despairing, Martin tottered out
of the office. But full of confidence in his ability
as a dyer, he decided to go to another factory and
offer his services.</p>

<p>His sad, depressed appearance, however, was
no good introduction in a place where only strong
hands were looked for, so nothing but disappointment
awaited him at the other places.</p>

<p>"The strike has ruined business," said one of
the manufacturers, while another laid the blame
on over-production. "Come in some other day,"
said a third.</p>

<p>During all these unsuccessful attempts to provide
the means of subsistence one week after another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
slipped away. Now the lack of the barest
necessities stared them in the face&mdash;bitter
need, upon whose hideous features they had not
before been forced to look.</p>

<p>And Eugene, in the delirium of his fever, was
always talking of the inaccessible maiden from
another sphere. His clear-sighted mother began
to grasp the meaning of all this with anxious
foreboding.</p>

<p>"What's to be done? What's to be done?"
the poor cripple asked himself, wringing his
hands, when he was notified that unless he paid
his back rent within twenty-four hours, he and his
family would be put into the street.</p>

<p>With despair in his heart he hastened out, and
sold everything of any value that was yet left to
him in order to avoid this disgrace.</p>

<p>"And then we'll get out of this unlucky
street!" cried the mother, sobbing and wiping the
hot tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>After a short family council it was decided to
move over to New York.</p>

<p>"No one knows me there; I can get any kind
of employment in New York&mdash;and work is easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to find there than it is here," said Martin to
comfort his sobbing wife.</p>

<p>A week later found the sorely-tried family in
one of the great barracks of tenements in the
lower part of the city. As a whole, the neighborhood
could not be surpassed for lack of comfort,
and little more appeared in the three bare rooms
tenanted by the Martin family.</p>

<p>Eugene's condition had improved, although
he was still confined to his bed; but the poor
father's mind was even more tormented by the fearful
spectre of poverty, and yet&mdash;in busy, populous
New York, surely, there was work to be found!</p>

<p>He was going upstairs one day when he was
stopped by a woman who was a stranger to him.
She opened an adjoining door, and asked him to
step into the room. Her husband was lying there
sick in bed and groaning with pain.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," began the woman, "my husband
is a street-cleaner&mdash;he sweeps Fifth Avenue,"
she added, with a proud intonation. "For
twenty-five years&mdash;mind that&mdash;he had done his
duty; and now the commissioners send for him
today and here he is, sick in bed and can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sweep his Fifth Avenue!" She went on with great
loquacity, without paying any heed to the
embarrassed face of her new neighbor.</p>

<p>"If you will take his place I will give you his
whole day's wages!" she shouted, handing him
the money together with the broom.</p>

<p>Martin was unable to resist the fascination of
coins so badly needed. The other street-cleaners
were waiting down stairs. After the robust woman
had communicated the whole affair to them
through the window they took Martin into their
ranks without any waste of words and marched
on before he had time to realize where he was going.
Pressing his hat over his eyes he hobbled
along with them as well as he could, while actual
tears rolled down into his grey beard.</p>

<p>But the thought of coming home at night with the
money he had earned soothed him to some extent.
His family need never know, and he was not
acquainted with another soul in the great city.</p>

<p>How sorely he was hurt by the knowledge that
his former employer's wife had seen him at this
undignified occupation is already known to the
reader.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>V.</big></p>


<p>On the evening in question Lucy was unusually
quiet and absorbed. She had scarcely seemed to
understand the loving words whispered in her ear
by her lover who sat beside her; she was obliged
to force herself, even, to return monosyllabic
answers to his questions. Her thoughts were
elsewhere. She had only been back from Palm Beach
a little while, and had heard nothing from the
family in which she was so much interested. But
her busy imagination depicted the well-known
room which contained the portfolio which had
played such a part in her life; and Eugene's fair,
curly head, and glowing, longing glances. Then
once more, she saw his father with the broom&mdash;the
almsgiving scene. Her thoughts were incessantly
occupied with the son of a street-cleaner!</p>

<p>A burning flush of shame overspread her pale
face, which George Elmore accepted as the answer
to his tenderly whispered entreaties that she
should become his wife at once, and kissed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
hand repeatedly.</p>

<p>The son of a street-cleaner to thrust himself
between her and George! Being what she was&mdash;a
proud woman and an heiress, she was startled.</p>

<p>"How could I so far forget myself!" she reflected.
"Heavens! if George were to suspect!"</p>

<p>She tried her best to drive away the embarrassing&mdash;nay,
the dishonoring thought. The idea struck her as
ludicrous&mdash;horribly ludicrous, and that disturbed her
even more.</p>

<p>Obviously there was but one way out of this
labyrinth of tormenting thoughts&mdash;to marry as soon
as possible. She had a mind to say the decisive
word this very evening and appoint, finally the day
for the wedding. As George's wife she would find rest
and healing for her stubborn heart in the fulfilment
of her duty, and be able to realize how foolish it
was to allow it unlimited play outside the bounds of
reason. In the meantime the poor family must be
helped. In spite of the foundations of reason which
she had just laid, she felt an interest in them.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It is nothing but sympathy for those
unfortunates," she tried to persuade herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Tomorrow she would have a talk with her father with
a view to having Martin restored to his old place in
the factory. She would pretend to have gained her
knowledge of their circumstances from a friend who
had employed their son for a short time.</p>

<p>She could not, however, entirely suppress the
pricks of conscience which told her that her silence
to her father had delayed this restoration, and
had thus been responsible for the complete destitution
of these worthy people.</p>

<p>Three days later Martin received orders through a
workman in the factory who knew his address to report
there with a view to resuming his former position.
Accordingly great joy prevailed in the Martin family.
Eugene was the only one now, weak and ill as he still
was, to remain gloomy and self-absorbed.</p>

<p>A gleam of happier feeling overspread his pale
face when he brought out Lucy's picture, now almost
completed, and heightened the attractiveness of the
cheeks, or made the thoughtful eyes yet more
speaking. And then he thought how, when it was all
done, he would seek her out and himself deliver it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to her, and once more he resolved to allow the full
fascination of her dear presence to work its will
upon him.</p>

<p>"And after that, I must avoid her&mdash;flee from
her! We must be as two stars which cannot tear
themselves from their own destined spheres, but
are forced to wander each in its own appointed
orbit," he murmured to himself with bitter pain,
gazing at the picture with unspeakable dejection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>VI.</big></p>


<p>The delicious month of May had now come
round once more. Nature, awakening to life, put
on its wondrous robe of many colors, and the sun
in proud consciousness of its power to tempt with
the alluring warmth, the flowers concealed in the
mystic bosom of Mother Earth, shone with ever
increasing fervency. In Central Park Nature's
feathered choir poured forth its gay song into the
lovely spring air, while the perfumed lilacs
lavished their scent upon all who came, caring not
whether the dweller in tenements breathed it in
greedily, or whether the superior residents of
Fifth Avenue ignored it contemptuously.</p>

<p>In the house of the rich manufacturer the perfume
of the lilacs was not missed; the most <i>recherche</i>
hot-house plants supplanting them in fragrance
were artistically grouped on both sides of the
great staircase down to the front door, filling
all the room with a perfume that bewildered the
senses. Servants in livery hastened busily, but
noiselessly, about, putting the last touches to the
decorations of the parlor for the wedding ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to be performed on this day. In the adjoining
room a beautiful altar was visible, decked with
superb flowers from which festoons of myrtle ran
up to a hanging bell of red and white roses.</p>

<p>Carriage after carriage rolled to the door,
from which descended fair guests, arrayed in
splendid Worth and Felix gowns, while faultlessly
dressed gentlemen helped them to alight.</p>

<p>In her room upstairs stood Lucy, in a white
dress and gold-embroidered veil, with orange
blossoms upon her bosom. Although apparently
calm, she was deathly pale, and her heart, whose
feelings had been suppressed with so much
difficulty, betrayed itself by violent beating.
A nameless uneasiness was upon her, almost
suffocating her at times. Eugene's fair head
and disquieting eyes were before her mind
vividly&mdash;now&mdash;when in an hour's time she would
be the bride of another. More than once she was
obliged to have recourse to the smelling-bottle
which stood upon the dressing-table, in order
not to give way&mdash;to be strong enough to bear the
torture of the ceremony with dignified calmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"The shock to my parents&mdash;the society in which I
move&mdash;no, no, there is no retreat for me!" she
murmured with decision in answer to her heart's
loud insistence. She was marrying George in
fulfillment of her parents' wishes and also to
escape from her tormenting self. That in making
this decision she had buried the ideals of her
youth&mdash;her life's happiness, no one should ever
guess. It was time now to steer boldly forth
into the deep sea of matrimony, deprived forever
of her life's compass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Denison, in a costly dress, had repeatedly
opened the window and gazed with anxious impatience
at all the carriages that came from the lower
part of the city, but she saw no sign of their
own carriage so impatiently awaited. Mr. Denison
had gone down town in the morning, promising
to be back before noon, and now it was four
o'clock.</p>

<p>Disquieting rumors had already begun to circulate
to the effect that the great banking house with
which their whole fortune was deposited was
on an unstable footing, owing to a rapid fall in
the stock market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Denison had said nothing of this to his
wife, although a horrible agitation had taken
possession of him, when, upon leaving the house he
had told the coachman to drive at full speed to the
banking house.</p>

<p>The guests were all assembled. The clergyman
was waiting, but still there was no sign of
Mr. Denison. An uneasy whisper, an ever-increasing
impatience, could be noticed. Mrs. Denison's thin
face took on a feverish red. Elmore's father was
just about to telephone down town, when, at last
the carriage rolled up to the door. The coachman,
excited with overdriving, leaped from his seat and
opened the carriage door; but he had no sooner cast
a glance into the carriage than he uttered a loud
cry, and with unsteady footsteps, hastened to
Mrs. Denison.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Denison, please don't
be alarmed&mdash;" he panted in a trembling voice,
"The big banking house down town failed this
morning&mdash;and&mdash;it seems&mdash;Mr. Denison was so
fearfully upset&mdash;so fearfully&mdash;when he came out
of the bank his face was all red&mdash;and I heard him
say in a low voice that he would have to fail too!
Yes&mdash;and now&mdash;please don't be frightened&mdash;he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
lying dead in the carriage!"</p>

<p>With a loud shriek, wringing her hands and
moaning, Mrs. Denison hastened to the carriage.
The gentlemen guests carried Mr. Denison's body,
still warm, into the house. "Heart failure," said
one to another. The women gathered around
Mrs. Denison, who was loudly weeping, and tried
to console her. Then one by one they stole away,
since it was quite obvious that there would be no
more thought of the marriage that day.</p>

<p>Lucy, worn out by weeks of mental agitation,
was overcome by the sudden shock of this sad
news, and fell back without a word upon the sofa,
gliding gently from it to the floor. A beneficent
unconsciousness clouded her perceptions. No one
had time to care for her; all the servants had been
sent right and left to bring medical aid for Mr.
Denison. All means of restoration were tried,
but failed to bring him back to life. "Apoplexy,"
said the physicians, and silently left the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lucy lay on the soft carpet without
a word or motion. In her dazzling white dress,
with the gold-embroidered veil, with the marble
paleness on her face, she looked like a sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
goddess who had fallen from her pedestal.</p>

<p>The last wedding guests, those who had helped
to carry Mr. Denison up to his room, had just
driven away, sighing and shaking their heads as
they discussed the sad event. The stillness of
death settled over the house. Suddenly a sound
was heard as of soft footsteps drawing near.
Then the door of Lucy's boudoir, which had been
left ajar, was gently opened. A curly-headed
young man with a disturbed countenance appeared
upon the threshold, looking right and left with
admiring wonder. The front door was still standing
open&mdash;no one had found time to close it.</p>

<p>Eugene, bringing Lucy's portrait, had thus
been able to penetrate unperceived, to the upper
story. Hardly able to believe his eyes, he gazed
at the fair form in bridal attire lying upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Startled and trembling in all his limbs, he was
about to close the door he had just opened, when
he caught sight of Lucy's face, pale as death,
through the veil. Hastily putting down the
portrait, he darted to her side, and trembling
with intense excitement, caught her cold hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to his heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="fair" id="fair"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image4.jpg" width="400" height="539" alt="SHE LAY ON THE FLOOR IN BRIDAL ATTIRE" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">HE GAZED AT THE FAIR FACE IN BRIDAL
ATTIRE LYING UPON THE FLOOR<br /></p>

<p>"Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy!" he cried, at first in
a low voice, then louder and more anxiously&mdash;but
she still lay there, cold and apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>Distracted, he looked about for help. He caught
sight of the smelling bottle which Lucy had
already used so often. He seized it quickly, pushed
aside her veil, and held it to her nostrils.</p>

<p>A slight tremor passed through the beautiful limbs.
Lucy moved her hand, but let it fall again. Eugene
sprang up joyfully. As if she had been a feather he
lifted the girl, now stirring a little. In blissful
intoxication, he clasped his heart's ideal for one
moment in his arms. Her breath played over his face,
making him tremble with delight&mdash;carrying him out
of himself, so that he pressed his lips to her's,
not knowing what he did. "How has this bright creature
filled my lonely life with sunshine!" he murmured
sadly to himself, as with a deep sigh he laid Lucy on
the sofa.</p>

<p>And then,&mdash;he felt the soft arms suddenly
thrown about his neck. Lucy, still dazed and
dreaming, had forgotten all about her wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
day, and knew nothing of her father's death.
Eugene's words of love had roused her from her
death-like stupor; she was conscious only of his
nearness&mdash;of the intoxication of his kiss.</p>

<p>"Oh, Eugene," she whispered, "what a lovely
dream!" She still lay with closed eyes. Eugene,
speechless with delight, pressed her passionately
to his beating heart. Lucy, startled, opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly George Elmore, his eyes blazing, stood
before her, looking down upon her haughtily.</p>

<p>Without losing his self-command in the least
he said with cutting scorn, "Oh, I am interrupting
a tete-a-tete! We have a lover, have we? Just
as well I have found it out in time! Ha, ha! I
wish you much happiness&mdash;especially as in my
own case my family would have to decline the
honor of an alliance with a bankrupt's daughter!"
Then he bowed coldly and went out.</p>

<p>Lucy, realizing the situation, uttered a cry and
attempted to rise, but once again overcome with
weakness, fell back with the same marble paleness
upon her brow.</p>

<p class="center"><big>VII.</big></p>


<p>Mr. Denison's funeral had already taken place
some weeks. Nearly every day Lucy had been seen
dressed in deep mourning, crossing to New
Jersey. In her firm serious face decision showed
itself as, hour after hour she bent over big
ledgers, separating debts from assets, while the
book-keeper stood by her side to offer her any
assistance in his power.</p>

<p>After a long and searching examination, it
became evident that the firm need not absolutely
declare itself insolvent, since the great banking
house in Wall Street whose reported failure had
brought the catastrophe to the Denison household,
had recovered itself, thanks to a favorable
turn in the stock-market, and promised to reimburse
all its creditors.</p>

<p>The Martin family, after all the severe trials
it had undergone in New York, had moved back
to New Jersey. Through the proved usefulness
of old Martin, who now labored with redoubled
eagerness to produce new and unheard of combinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of color, the prestige of the factory, which had
sunk low in the silk market, now began to rise
again to its former height.</p>

<p>Lucy and her mother, selling their fine house
on Fifth Avenue, had also moved to New Jersey,
in the vicinity of the works, since Lucy insisted
upon superintending everything herself. She
trembled with impatience and joy when Eugene's
fair curly head was seen approaching the house.</p>

<p>On the expiration of her year of mourning she
gave her hand to the man to whom her heart has
long been given.</p>

<p>The happy couple spent their honeymoon in
Italy. The high ideals which had once inflamed
the young painter's heart, and later had threatened
to die out in comfortless annihilation, were destined
at last to take shape, and to stand before his
enchanted eyes in all their beautiful reality. At
last he was able, hand in hand with his beloved,
to admire the art treasures of Rome, the Vatican,
with its immortal paintings by Raphael, Michael
Angelo and Paul Veronese. All that they had
long known through copies and engravings were
now before them in the original, and filled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
with delight.</p>

<p>Eugene availed himself of the permission
given to artists three days in the week to make
copies in the Vatican galleries. Standing at their
easels, Eugene and Lucy painted side by side, as
they had once done at the Art School, with
unbounded happiness beaming in their eyes. Among
the masterpieces which represented the highest
ideals of art, Lucy realized more and more with a
palpitating heart, the omnipotence of true love.</p>

<h2>THE STREET SINGER</h2>

<p class="center"><big>A VIENNESE STORY</big></p>


<p class="center"><big>I.</big></p>


<p>Winter, hard and merciless as a tax collector,
stalked threateningly before the dilapidated doors
of Vienna's poor.</p>

<p>Back of the white Tanneries, not far from the
magnificently built Franz Josef's bridge, where
misery and dire poverty had made their dreary
home for many decades, winter seemed harder and
colder than elsewhere; for with the poor wretched
creatures who dwell near these Tanneries, there
is&mdash;as everybody knows&mdash;but little sympathy.</p>

<p>A sweet-looking girl, hardly fourteen years of
age, came shivering with bent head, out of one
of the poorest and dirtiest homesteads of the
poverty-stricken district.</p>

<p>Her thin, threadbare gingham dress, torn in
many places, exposed here and there the trembling
little form beneath. Over it she wore an old,
shabby-looking plaid shawl&mdash;apparently her
mother's&mdash;which blown back now and again by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
unceremonious wind, exposed to view an old violin.
She held it as tight as if it were the only earthly
treasure she possessed. A ribbon, that had once
been blue, held up her knotted hair, and gave her
the appearance of a gipsy. And as for her shoes,
it would seem that only the upper part had preserved
a right to the name; for her stiff-frozen
little toes were almost on the ground.</p>

<p>She walked on and on, greatly oppressed, giving
no heed to the cruel wind that played havoc
with her fluttering curls. Her large black eyes,
which held a singular fascination in their sparkling
depths, were now filled with burning tears.</p>

<p>She was barely on the threshold of girlhood,
but life in its unfathomable savagery, had already
thrown its challenging gauntlet in her frightened,
childish face. She felt instinctively that poor
little outcast as she was, she must not shrink from
battle, but struggle on as best she could either
with cruel wind and weather or with bitter cold
and want.</p>

<p>She had struggled bravely, never minding how
fruitless her little efforts seemed. But the one
thing to which she had never accustomed herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and which made a storm of tears rain down her pale
face, was the frightful apparition of the hollow-eyed
skeleton, hunger&mdash;that hunger which now held
sway over her sick mother's house.</p>

<p>A heavy, shuddering sigh broke from her lips.
The utter need and helplessness of her mother
and four smaller sisters, for days deprived of
all necessaries of life, even of bread to satisfy
their hunger, had driven her from the house, their
cries and lamentations still ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>"Poor and friendless, with no one to care for
us, and poor, dear mother lying ill," she moaned
in a suffocating voice, wiping tears of agony from
her white face. "It wrings my heart to see her
and the little ones so hungry," she said to
herself, sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>Near the Franz Josef's bridge she saw a little
tavern. She timidly opened the door and entered,
quickly producing the old violin. The instrument
was the only bequest of her dear father, who had
been a musician, and who had instructed her in
this art, detecting at an early age her ardent
love of study and thirst for a musical education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing near the open door, she first played
an obligato which she executed in masterly fashion,
and then commenced to sing an old German song, so
touchingly&mdash;knowing what was at stake&mdash;that the
people in the tavern, and many passers-by who
stopped in amazement at the door, gazed with
wondering eyes at the ragged little dark-eyed girl
hardly grown out of her baby shoes; and many of
them, moved by deep pity, though poor themselves,
tossed one, and some of them two coins into her
apron. More they could not afford to give, lest
their liberality might eventually expose them
to the same plight.</p>

<p>Christine beamed with happiness. When her
song was finished, she quickly took out of her
apron her gathered treasure, counting it with
shining eyes. Twenty kreutzers&mdash;she counted
them again and again. Her stiff little fingers
could not hold all at once, but her eyes, wet with
happy emotion, were fastened on each of them,
and her heart leaped within her at the sight. So
many she had never before earned.</p>

<p>She folded her hands as if in fervent prayer,
and lifted her dark eyes to Heaven in gratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
thinking of the joy she would bring to her mother
and half-starved sisters when she returned home
with an apron-full of fresh baked rolls.</p>

<p>"Say,&mdash;Miss&mdash;won't ye let me carry yer&mdash;fiddle?"</p>

<p>The whisper sank into her ear. She turned hastily
around, and saw a poorly-dressed shoemaker's
apprentice standing near, gazing at her
with his large blue eyes. In his hands he held an
old pair of shoes.</p>

<p>He stood, quite silent, with enthusiasm for
Christine's exquisite singing beaming from every
feature. Presently, with a timid grin, he held out
the pair of shoes.</p>

<p>"Here, Miss. I ain't got no money, but I'd
like badly ter give you them shoes&mdash;er&mdash;ter show
you that I like good singing. Yes, I do, an' ye
sing mighty well," he said, looking admiringly at
her and getting as red in the face as an over-ripe
apple. "I'll surely get a good cuff or two from
master for giving them away, but a shoemaker's
boy is used to that, and doesn't care a rap if
once in a while he takes a good piff, paff, pouff!"
With this exclamation of Meyerbeerian bravado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
he demonstrated the operatic knowledge of an
up-to-date Viennese apprentice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="money" id="money"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image5.jpg" width="400" height="560" alt="I'D LIKE TER GIVE YER THEM SHOES" />
</a></div>
<p class="center">"HERE, MISS, I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY,
BUT I'D LIKE TER GIV YER THEM SHOES."<br /></p>

<p>Christine looked at him with shining eyes.
She understood only one thing&mdash;that he wanted
to give her a pair of shoes, which, in her
estimation seemed almost new. She beamed at him
so gratefully with her large, dark eyes, that the
embarrassed apprentice, who was about two years
older than she, felt a hot wave running down his
spine. Never had a lovelier face or sweeter eyes
smiled so kindly at the bewildered boy.</p>

<p>"They're yourn, an'&mdash;ye'd better try 'em on&mdash;an'
see if they'll fit," he stammered bashfully.
This strange, heavenly shyness was a new sensation
for the rough apprentice lad. Until this moment
he had never known that there existed such an
organ as a palpitating heart within his body.</p>

<p>And before Christine knew how, the new shoes
were on her feet. Shoes without holes! Goodness!
how could it have happened? And without holes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope I am not dreaming," she murmured
to herself, her face aglow.</p>

<p>"Will ye let me go with ye?" asked the
simple-hearted boy, his eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not now; but&mdash;on Sunday you can
come."</p>

<p>"To yer house? My name is Peter," he replied,
greatly bewildered, as he could not think&mdash;to
save his soul&mdash;of anything more important
than his name.</p>

<p>"Yes, to my house; and then you can go with
me and carry the violin," Christine answered
with a sweet smile. But suddenly, ashamed of her
boldness, she stopped and counted her kreutzers
again.</p>

<p>Peter, however, looked at her with such admiration
in his big blue eyes, that something like an
electric spark shot through her. Such a happy
sensation she had never felt; for no one had ever
spoken such kind, encouraging words to her. A
tinge of red leaped into her pale cheeks; there
was a trembling pant in her voice, when, with
averted face, she told him the street and number.
Tucking her violin under her arm, she ran quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
up the street.</p>

<p>At the nearest bakery she stopped in order to
buy the coveted rolls. But Peter, still under the
charm of her large, expressive eyes, stood as if
rooted to the ground, gazing after her and listening
to the receding tap-tap of the little shoes on
her feet, which he now realized belonged to some
one else. He began to dread the expected punishment,
which he knew would be meted out, not so much in
curtain lectures as in striking actions, and for
some time he stood stock still, racking his brain
for an excuse to make their singular disappearance
plausible. But his natural light-heartedness soon
got the better of him. Shrugging his shoulders, and
singing "Piff, paff, pouff, brennet sie," he rushed
away, ready to meet his inexorable fate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>II.</big></p>


<p>"Goodness! you haven't eaten anything all
day long, and I bet you're feeble," cried Mrs.
Langohr, the next-door neighbor of Christine's
mother, throwing the door of her miserable
two-room apartment wide open, so that all the
neighbors should hear, and praise her charitable
inclinations. "O, my God, have mercy on them poor
little worms! I must go and make a little farina
soup for 'em. See, that's what I am getting out
of the Bible! Be good to yer neighbor," she said
in a loud tone, apparently for the benefit of the
poorly-clad and shy-looking women at the windows.</p>

<p>"O, holy Father in Heaven! Just look here,"
she screamed, amazed when Christine suddenly
appeared with twenty hot rolls in her apron,
showing them triumphantly to the neighbors. And
rushing into the apartment, she, with a gladdened
heart, distributed them among the starving
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeble mother with eyes full of tears,
glancing thankfully toward Heaven, listened to
Christine's wonderful story about the shoes and
the twenty kreutzers. It seemed incredible. So
much happiness in one day! And Christine's
beautiful smile seemed to fill the squalid room
with radiance when she thought of Sunday and the
expected arrival of the shoemaker's bashful boy.</p>

<p>Her happiness increased day by day; for every
Sunday Peter punctually arrived, always bringing
some unusual delicacies with him, and accepting
gladly Christine's consent to carry the violin.
In fact, he carried it with such dignity and
pride, that, standing behind her, it often
happened that he bowed his acknowledgment to the
audience at the end of each morceau, quite as if
he were her partner and one of the performing
artists. Then he would take his old cap and gather
the contributions, always returning them faithfully
to Christine. Every piece of wood that he could
deftly worm out of his mistress' household, he
carried to Mrs. Miller, Christine's mother, to
warm the chilled little limbs of her starving
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>His mistress, the shoemaker's wife, often
wondered that the cooked potatoes disappeared
from the dinner table as suddenly as if the earth
had swallowed them up. She certainly could not
imagine that they invariably disappeared into
Peter's side-pockets although his occasional
grimaces and the red spots on his sensitive skin
bore open testimony.</p>

<p>"Now, now, goodness! what's the matter with
you, rascal?" the surprised mistress would cry,
viewing amazedly his distorted face. And one
day, in spite of his Spartan heroism, Peter could
not stand it any longer.</p>

<p>"I am sick&mdash;stomach-ache&mdash;" he stammered, vainly
trying to compose himself, and even forcing a
sickly smile to his pale lips.</p>

<p>"You grown-up earthworm, you! The idea of having
stomach-ache every day at this time!" she
responded angrily, adding a few choice words out
of her voluminous vocabulary. But being not bad
at heart, sympathy soon gained the upper hand,
and she said in a milder tone, giving him a
small coin with a gesture indicative of large
liberality&mdash;"Here, you stupid nuisance, you! Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and get a penny's worth of English bitters."</p>

<p>Peter did not require a second command to leave
the room. He took the hint and the penny and went
straight to Christine's house. But once outside,
and in respectable distance from his mistress'
observing eyes, he quickly removed the red-hot
potatoes from his pant's pockets.</p>

<p>Peter had always been accustomed to save the
tips that he received from his master's patrons
when he carried home their shoes&mdash;chiefly for
Sunday nights, that he might enjoy a seat in the
last gallery at the theatre. And my! hadn't he
been proud and happy when sitting there in his
best well-worn suit, and hearing those wonderful
songs, "Belle Helene," in Offenbach's toneful
operetta, and others which he could not get out
of his head for months.</p>

<p>Sometimes, if he had any money left, he would
indulge in such luxuries as a half herring and a
glass of Pilsner, being a great gourmand. But
since he had come to know Christine, everything
seemed to have changed. He no longer went to
the theatre, but saved all his tips, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
about as if a secret were hidden in his breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Langohr," cried Christine's mother,
one cold morning to her next-door neighbor.
"Don't laugh, for it is true. Peter has bought a
dress for Christine, a winter dress, just
imagine!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Langohr held up her hands in amazement.
But it was really true. Peter had bought Christine,
with his savings, a warm dress, at a second-hand
store. Christine was beside herself with joy; she
had never known in these days what it was to have
a warm rag on her back, and her gratitude welled
up and overflowed in her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>As Christmas-time gradually approached, Mrs. Miller,
feeling much better in health, commenced to perform
her household duties. But Christine's earnings from
her singing and violin diminished as the holidays
drew near, and the simple little income seemed
about to vanish altogether. Even Peter's pour-boire
money threatened to cease, causing him restless
nights and much down-heartedness. This discouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
condition of things took all his former desire for
playing pranks out of the formerly gay-spirited
shoemaker's boy.</p>

<p>And when pious processions of tired pilgrims
passed through the streets of Vienna, singing and
praying on their way to church, he no longer
played any of his old mischievous tricks on them,
but took off his hat devoutly, and marched along,
praying with folded hands and wet eyes.</p>

<p>"Blessed Virgin&mdash;be good to her&mdash;I pray to thee&mdash;but
not for myself&mdash;no; only for Christine&mdash;she lives
under the white Tanneries&mdash;only for her I pray!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>III.</big></p>


<p>A chilling north wind whistled through the
deserted streets of the Austrian metropolis, and
the snow, towering mountain high, driven by the
gale, whirled blindingly around the muffled,
shivering pedestrians, hastening hurriedly to
their respective homes.</p>

<p>The Franzenering, where the Viennese aristocrats
are accustomed to meet in the afternoon hours,
to drink tea, consume little cakes and indulge
in gay conversations, today was totally empty.
No one, it seemed, had ventured to brave the
storm, in spite of the attractive display in the
show-windows of elegantly designed gowns and
hats. And these same show windows were certainly
remarkable, for all adornments dear to the
feminine heart, wonderful achievements of unusual
millinery effects, dazzled the eyes of both young
and old.</p>

<p>Christine, holding her violin with stiffened
little fingers, stood pale and trembling before one
of the most magnificent windows, speechless with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
wonder, gazing as if in a trance at this modern
splendor of feminine attire, the like of which she
had never conceived even in her wildest, most
fantastic dreams.</p>

<p>Her heart contracted painfully. She thought of her
mother and little sisters, freezing, half-starved,
hopelessly expectant of Christmas, and her glorious
eyes blurred with tears, as she remembered that
she, as the bread-winner of the family, was not
able to buy them anything for Christmas, not even
bread enough to satisfy their hunger. For the
first time in her life, she could not think of God
and Heaven without bitterness for it seemed that
he had indeed forsaken her and her family.</p>

<p>"O God, I thought I was doing my best," she
stammered with burning tears running down her
blanched face. "What have we done, that we of
all others, should die of hunger?" The future
stretched before her inner vision, a weary blank,
lit by no ray of hope. Convulsively, she clutched
the old violin, and wandered away, farther and
farther into the raging storm, drifting wherever
the wind blew, without aim and without purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
or hope.</p>

<p>The north wind in its increasing fury, commenced
to batter tin roofs, chimney-tops, blinds,
awnings, flag-poles, as if a giant hand were at
work, while odds and ends of debris fell crashing
into the streets to bury themselves in the drifts.
Those unfortunates who were compelled to brave
the elements, fought their way onward like wild
beasts, cursing, shouting and screaming aloud.</p>

<p>Half-frozen, nearly blinded by the storm and
the hail that cut her delicate face like a knife,
Christine suddenly found herself before the open
portal of a palatial house. Driven by a momentary
impulse for shelter from the cold, penetrating
blast, she entered. At once a ray of hope
illumined her desolate face. Now, if she were to
try once more, and sing for these rich people,
warm and comfortable behind those windows!</p>

<p>Quickly she withdrew her violin from its battered
case, and began in quivering tones to sing the
Lorelei her father had taught her, before anyone
was aware of her presence. The wonderful tones of
her high soprano rang through the stately mansion,
vibrating clear and penetrating all the rooms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, here, the impertinence!" cried the
irritated porter, jumping out of his porter's
lodge, pale with anger, and pointing to a sign
conspicuously hanging in the entrance of the
spacious porte-cochere. "How dare you, mean
little baggage, you! Can't you see that beggers
and organ-grinders are not allowed to enter
here? Heh! screaming at the top of her voice in
such weather! Get out! get out! quick! march!"
His tone was sneering, and his lips curled
contemptuously as he waved his hand
disdainfully for her to leave the courtyard.</p>

<p>Greatly frightened and trembling in all her
frozen little limbs, Christine was about to obey,
and covered her violin, timidly looking at the
porter's ugly red face, when suddenly a window
on the first floor was flung open. The elegant
form of a middle-aged man, with gold-rimmed
eye-glasses, leaning out of the window, gave the
porter so imperious a command to withdraw at once,
that the startled man, hardly daring to lift his
eyes to this illustrious personage, retired with
many a bob and scrape to his porter's lodge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Christine, greatly encouraged by this incident,
and anxious to use the opportunity, began to sing
anew; for she thought that if she won the favor of
the man at the window, it must surely mean help
for her sorely-tried family. So she sang the
Lorelei again&mdash;sang overpoweringly those lovely,
mystic notes&mdash;"Das hat mit threm singen die
Lorelei gethan."</p>

<p>The superb sound burst forth from the little
shivering form, rocked here and there by the
raging storm, and seemed to breathe the longings
and distress of a pure childish soul. This piteous
appeal for help through the medium of Listz's
greatest legendary love-song, was not without
effect.</p>

<p>"Superb&mdash;a phenomenon&mdash;a star!" murmured the
man at the window in amazement. He leaned out
into the storm, gazing intently at the young
singer, for he was no less a personage than Duke
Hohenlohe, the greatest musical critic and
enthusiast in all Vienna. He withdrew from the
window, closing it with a snap.</p>

<p>Christine was speechless with joy, and her dark,
glowing eyes flashed in excited bewilderment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a richly liveried butler came down the stairs into
the courtyard, handing her five gulden and demanding
her address. She stood there&mdash;her face flushed with
wonder, and her childish lips parted as if hearing
the magic music of another world. Cyclones of wind,
thundering waves of ice and snow were forgotten.
Hope had entered her heart, and with the five gulden
clasped tightly to her breast, she made her way out
of the courtyard, past the porter's lodge into the
street. She hurried along as best she could, her heart
singing a holy song of gratitude, and her lips smiling
at the thought of the happiness she was bringing to
those at home. The last part of the way she ran and
burst into the room where the family were huddled over
a few half dead coals, like a childish almoner of
plenty, stammering out her tale.</p>

<p>"It must have been the Lord holy, Jesus Christ,
who had mercy on me and my children," cried the
invalid mother, trembling with excitement, and
folding her thin hands devoutly. "O Lord," she
continued, "most mighty and most merciful Saviour
of all the widows and orphans, accept the lowly
thanks of a poor invalid." She looked up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Heaven with a gladdened heart as she saw her
children happy, and for once, well-fed.</p>

<p>But Christine sat in a corner of the poorly
furnished room as if in a dream. A vague, confused
remembrance of all that had happened in the
courtyard filled her with bewilderment. The only
thing she really saw plainly was the joyous faces
around her, the result of her gift&mdash;the five
gulden she had received.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>IV.</big></p>

<p>The whole neighborhood was in an uproar. A score
of tongues were wagging, ears were cocked to
hear the news, and gesticulations and cries were
everywhere. Even the invalids of the white
Tanneries with their ridiculous looking caps,
stretched their shaky heads out of the windows
in order to listen to the great news related by
Mrs. Langohr, the wandering gossip-monger of
this poverty-stricken district.</p>

<p>"A real Count has heard her on Christmas Eve,
you say?"</p>

<p>"A Count! Naw! Something higher up, smarty,"
snapped the gossip-monger, raising her voice to
a shrill pitch and throwing herself into the
proper attitude of importance. "It was a Duke
if you want to know it. Yes, he heard her, and
yesterday sent his carriage for her."</p>

<p>"His carriage!" echoed the crowd, and fell back
amazed, unwilling to trust their own ears.</p>

<p>"With four white horses attached to it,"
added Mrs. Langohr with a triumphant laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
"A girl from our suburb, imagine!"</p>

<p>"Hump! that's a greater miracle than the stories
of the returning Pilgrims from Rome," sniffed an
old, wrinkled woman, shaking her ludicrously
shaped head with a certain vehemence and "soit
disant" dignity which eminently befitted one
enjoying the reputation of the female Socrates
of the suburb.</p>

<p>The nightcaps at the windows commenced to
shake visibly, and a heated argument of possible
reasons for this exciting event followed.</p>

<p>"What will he do with her?" asked the female
Socrates with solemnity, wiping each wrinkle
separately with a dubious-looking red
handkerchief, a sign that she intended to
cross-examine everybody rigidly.</p>

<p>"What he&mdash;the Duke will do? He will make a great
singer out of her, smarty," sneered the next-door
neighbor, disappearing quickly indoors, to the
great disappointment of the neighbors who had
gathered for the purpose of hearing the great
news at first hand with all the details.</p>

<p>"A great singer?" asked the shaky nightcaps
at the windows, with dubious smiles, ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
what had gone before, and looking in blank
amazement at each other. "Who&mdash;who is he?"</p>

<p>But so it had actually happened.</p>

<p>Christine had attracted first the attention, then
the interest of Duke Hohenlohe, and had been
placed in the Vienna Conservatory of Music. Here,
as a protege of one of its principal patrons, she
was being carefully instructed by the most
prominent singing teachers of the institution, and
making extraordinary progress.</p>

<p>But poor Peter! He had become so downcast at the
loss of his little friend, that he cared nothing
for even the merriest of his former pranks, and
spent his time in counting the days until he
could see her again. He had promised Christine
before she had gone to the Conservatory, to help
her family in every way he could, and what Peter
promised, he kept faithfully. But, oh! how dear
Christine had become to him&mdash;how necessary to
his very existence! He gladly deprived himself
of even the barest necessities of life in order
to be of service to her and the mother and
sisters she loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Now&mdash;in the few months that she had been living
near the Conservatory, how tall and beautiful
she had grown, and what depths of expression lay
in her dark, speaking eyes! Goodness! the
simple-hearted shoemaker's boy felt his heart
leap and tremble, when he dared to look into their
sparkling wells of light, they followed him
whether he waked or slept.</p>

<p>He saw them in his grimy little shop, talked to
them when he was sewing on buttons, or knocking
vigorously at the hard, unresponsive leather,
and smiled happily at the visionary picture always
before his mind's eye, to the great astonishment
of his observing mistress.</p>

<p>So five years sped by&mdash;five years which seemed
five eternities to Peter's love-sick heart. But
these five years had developed the pretty,
sad-eyed girl into a beautiful, graceful woman,
with a clever vigorous intellect, and an ambition
to reach the highest eminence within the grasp of
true womanhood and constant endeavor in the world
of song.</p>

<p>So there was but little time to give poor Peter,
as her approaching debut was near, and Christine
studied night and day, with tireless energy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
important roles which she would be expected to
portray.</p>

<p>In the meantime, dark clouds were gathering on
the horizon of the Austrian monarchy. Rebellion
after rebellion broke out on the southern frontier
of its vast dominions, and Peter, now of age, was
enlisted as a soldier, and sent away to the
centre of the insurgent provinces. He had to
march with his regiment in the darkness of the
night without even being able to see Christine to
utter a few parting words. He was heart-broken,
though what he wanted to tell her was not known
even to himself. All he knew was that he loved
her dearly, and that his tortured, love-sick heart
was writhing and bleeding at the thought that
months and months would pass before he could
again set eyes on her slender, graceful figure,
and lovely smiling face.</p>

<p>The ensuing scenes of war and bloodshed sickened
him; but Christine's hallowed picture, always
with him, gave him strength to withstand all
horrors. She appeared as the radiant star of his
life, and he was guided in his loneliness by the
single hope of seeing her again. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
ignorant simple lad covered his face and wept&mdash;wept
tears of despair and joy in anticipating that
inexpressible happiness which the future might
hold in store.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>V.</big></p>


<p>To the music-loving public of Vienna, first nights
and debuts of promising students are great events,
especially when the aspirants for musical honors
come from the home conservatory, and more especially
when a certain student of the conservatory is
heralded as a singer with a phenomenal voice, which
she will display in the famous role of Lucia di
Lammermoor.</p>

<p>So it was that long before the doors of the imposing
opera house were opened, eager crowds excitedly
discussing the appearance of the new singer, stood
at the entrance impatiently awaiting the hour. And
before the portals had been thrown open half an
hour, the great house was filled to suffocation.</p>

<p>Many of the Austrian nobility sat in their private
boxes, and those persons belonging to the
aristocracy occupied seats in the parterre and, in
fact, every available place. The people, dangerously
crowding the galleries, looked in open-eyed
wonder at the stage where Christine, in the costume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of Lucia stood trembling with shy timidity. A vague
terror overshadowed her lovely features. She was
endeavoring heroically to enter into her role, but
the sight of so many people, whom for the first time
she saw assembled, and the countless number of eager
eyes riveted on her, made her dizzy. She lost her
courage, and stood there helpless and frightened with
downcast eyes, unable to commence, in spite of the
fact that the nervous stage manager in the wings had
already twice given her the cue.</p>

<p>The director of the conservatory stood in the wings
at the opposite side of the stage, and nodded
encouragingly to her. But as she seemed not to see
him, he became livid, and wrathfully commenced to
revile himself for having yielded to the temptation
of bestowing this difficult role on Duke Hohenlohe's
protege, who evidently was not sufficiently trained
in self-control to appear as an independent star.</p>

<p>Just at the decisive moment, however, Duke
Hohenlohe entered the proscenium box and smiled
kindly at her. Christine's fingers closed
spasmodically over each other. She perceived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
last what was at stake.</p>

<p>With eyes full of tears, she controlled herself
by a superb effort, and looked up at him as if
saying: "You may trust me. I shall be equal to
the situation," and then she began to sing, at
first timidly and tremulously, but soon carried
away by the grandeur of this passionate role, she
surpassed herself; her high notes echoed through
every part of the vast opera house with such
dazzling magnificence, that an uproarious "Bravo,"
rang vociferously forth from thousands of voices,
and thousands of hands applauded wildly.</p>

<p>And when she had rendered the great bravura aria
in the second act, with rare perfection, a continuous
storm of applause greeted her. Duke Hohenlohe smiled
with gratification. He was indeed proud of his
little protege, whom he had discovered in the
blinding snow storm.</p>

<p>The director of the Conservatory, still standing
in the wings, could not believe his eyes and
ears. Christine was not only a great singer, but
she had proved herself a great actress. The manner
in which she had portrayed the mad Lucia was
an immense surprise. Flowers and bouquets of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
sizes and colors flew from all directions upon the
young debutante. Curtseying timidly, her lovely
face flushed and happy beyond description, she
looked at the corner in the second gallery where
Mrs. Miller sat praying with folded hands, as if
in a trance.</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;dear Mother," she murmured to
herself, with profound humility, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Duke Hohenlohe had just entered the imperial
box where sat the Emperor. With a reverential
bow, and a look of great satisfaction on his
noble face, he said smilingly:</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, it was I who discovered the new
star."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Tell me how," responded his Majesty,
greatly interested.</p>

<p>"I happened to listen to her singing on Christmas
Eve. She stood in my courtyard with an old
broken violin and shivered with cold; and when
she sang the Lorelei, the snow circled around her
wretched little form. It was a pity."</p>

<p>"Duke, you have aroused my curiosity. Can
I&mdash;?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"See her? Oh, your Majesty&mdash;the great honor&mdash;she
will be overwhelmed," the Duke replied, bowing
deeply as he withdrew from the imperial box.</p>

<p>An instant later, Christine, greatly confused
and flattered by the request of the Emperor, stood
in his presence and received his hearty
congratulations. As if in a dream she glanced at
the second gallery where her mother still sat, and
wept tears of joy. The Emperor cordially extended
his royal hand, which she was permitted to kiss
before retiring. The following day the success of
the new star as Lucia was heralded over the city.
The leading journals contained long articles
about her magnificent rendering of the difficult
role, and the beauty of her voice, at the same
time, complimenting the committee of directors of
the Imperial Opera House for this opportunity
given to native talent, thus making an exception
to the general rule that prophets are not recognized
in their own country.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>VI.</big></p>


<p>"Your first appearance was a triumph that will
live in the memory of Vienna, my dear Christine.
In fact, your magnificent rendering of a role
which only such singers as Patti, Sembrich and
Melba have attempted, has exceeded all
expectations. Candidly, I had commenced to blame
myself for having yielded to the wishes of Duke
Hohenlohe," said the director of the Conservatory
with a radiant smile, as he entered Christine's
simple four-room apartment, a day later. "And
I am most glad to have been commissioned by the
Board of Directors to offer you a three years'
contract with a suitable salary&mdash;but, my dear
girl, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Christine stood before him pale as a ghost. A
slight tremor shook her slender frame, her eyes
were downcast and red with weeping. She stammered
a few words which the director could not
understand.</p>

<p>He scrutinized her face sharply, being wholly
puzzled, as he endeavored to fathom the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
cause of this state of mind.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear girl, if I express my surprise.
I hope you are not dissatisfied with your debut.
Why, you ought to be singing rhapsodies&mdash;be filled
with ambition and enthusiasm&mdash;after being received
by his Majesty and complimented upon your
remarkable success."</p>

<p>Without replying, her lips quivering and dumb,
Christine slowly and solemnly opened the door of
the adjacent room. A mysterious, oppressive
something seemed to fill the room like the
shadow of death.</p>

<p>In the centre was a catafalque, at the end of
which stood two lighted candles, sputtering lightly
like the last feeble shrieks of a departing soul.
Near the catafalque, on a small pedestal, rested
the picture of poor Peter, embedded in a mass of
roses.</p>

<p>The autumn sun, shining through the lilac and
myrtle boughs that rustled close to the window,
glinted over the pure, pale face of the singer.
Mournfully, her tearful eyes sought the object of
her deep devotion. On a black velvet cushion near
Peter's picture, stood a pair of old shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
surrounded by jasmine and white camelias. A ray
of sunshine stealing through the myrtle leaves
made golden ripples on the shoes.</p>

<p>Christine pressed her hand to her heart, as if
beholding that scene in the tavern of her
childhood days. "Not yesterday," she said to the
director in a trembling voice&mdash;"not yesterday,
but five years ago I made my debut as a singer,
when I earned these shoes in recognition of my
singing&mdash;from him&mdash;" She pointed to Peter's
picture, almost overcome by emotion.</p>

<p>"I sympathize most keenly with you, but my
dear girl, what are they?"</p>

<p>"They are my only mementoes of my dear friend Peter,
who lost his life in the service of the Empire&mdash;the
first victim of the terrible rebellion at the
Southern frontier." She stopped, unable to continue,
while her heart contracted painfully, and big tears
of sympathy and love for the shoemaker's apprentice
trickled down her blanched face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Christine is now one of the greatest opera stars on
the horizon, and her sisters are following in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
footsteps. But every year when the sad day of
poor Peter's death comes, Christine, clothed all
in black, goes out to the cemetery with flowers in
hand, and sits for hours under the pure white
marble obelisk where, in gilded letters, these
words are traced:</p>

<p class="center"><i>ERECTED IN HONOR OF PETER STARK</i>,<br />

<i>By his devoted, sorrowing friend</i>,<br />

<p>Many large and small boats were dancing merrily
on the Bay of Castellamare, so richly populous
with many rare species of fish. The mirrorlike
blue surface was only ruffled by the small
steamers on their way to and from Sorrento,
carrying throngs of pleasure-seeking tourists
from all parts of the world.</p>

<p>On the right hand shore, extended on a high
promontory receding a little from the shore,
stands peacefully dreaming and forgotten, by the
outer world, the little village of Vico Ecquenso.</p>

<p>The innumerable small fishing smacks belonging
to the villagers ("paesani") dot the bay as
far as Castellamare, and every morning they make
their way thither, carrying to market their nightly
catches of tunny fish, anchovies and other dumb
subjects of Neptune.</p>

<p>The valleys, perfumed throughout their length
with odorous herbs, palms and gigantic cactus in
wild profusion, change their character a little
further away, by taking on the indescribable charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the picturesquely draughted olive trees, which
often slope down to the water's edge, while on
green hillside terraces most magnificent grapes
gleam from afar, like red glittering rubies to the
eyes of the delighted tourist.</p>

<p>On the left side, amid palms and chestnut trees,
one catches a glimpse of the lifeless unroofed ruins
of Pompeii, once a populous city, which was
overwhelmed by her mighty neighbor, the terrible
Vesuvius on the 22nd of August in the year
79, and remained under ground for about eighteen
centuries, until Charles the III ordered its
excavation on the 1st of April, 1748. Amid all
these buried treasures of art of long perished
races, Seneca had spent his youth and Cicero had
written his biting rhetorical masterpieces, which
earned him a sixteen months' banishment from the
court of the Emperor Claudius, whose gigantic
statue of Persian marble, in the robe of "Pontifex
Maximus" was lately excavated at Pesto.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The high mountains were already casting long
shadows through the little village of Vico
Ecquenso, and the hot evening sun, now about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
sink into the gently splashing waves, gilded with
its last beams the weather-beaten, centuries-old
convent of Santa Croce, built upon a high summit
on green hilltops.</p>

<p>The peaceful sound of the old convent bell,
inviting those to pious meditations and evening
prayer, was sounding now with wondrous sweetness
over land and sea, even as far as the desolate
altars of the heathen Gods of Pompeii tumbled
down from their gilded pedestals, and the shrunken
mummies in the "theatrum tragico," where the
people perished without the help of the heathen
gods, listened dumb and petrified,&mdash;the sightless
eyes wide open,&mdash;to the sounds of the new religion
calling them again and again morning and evening.
The vast oppressiveness of the ghostly solitude
there, contrasted strangely with the uncommon
bustle perceptible that evening among the simple
minded inhabitants of the quaint little village,
who usually went so quietly about their work.</p>

<p>A joyous excitement sparkled in the eyes of both
old and young, who had assembled in front of the
only village tavern, "Osteria," to witness the
approach of the festal procession of youth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
maidens coming home from the vineyards, laden
with baskets of grapes and flowers.</p>

<p>The wealthiest man in the place, the farmer Niccolo
Gallioti, who had just before devoutly lit six
immense wax candles in honor of the Holy Madonna,
was today giving a feast to the young people
of the place. The ingathered harvest had filled
all his granaries to the roofs and so surpassed all
his expectations that it had to be celebrated with
eating and drinking, music and dancing. An hour
before, he had been seen walking up towards the
vineyards at the side of his beautiful daughter,
Concetta, and as yet there was no sign of their
return. The expecting crowd shuffled up and
down impatiently, and craned their necks.</p>

<p>"There! There! Corpo di bacco! they're coming now,"
cried a small bare-footed lazzaroni, greatly
excited, running breathlessly to meet them, and
vainly trying at the same time to hold up the torn,
shapeless breeches, which actually had no right to
that name. They were fastened by a cord on the top
and reached from the shoulders to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>All the inhabitants of the village seemed to be
present, and pressed forward in a confused mass,
each one anxious to be the first one to greet the
festal train, principally Galiotti the liberal host
and dispenser of the best wine.</p>

<p>In the rear, unobserved, stood a man of about
twenty-eight years, in an elegant summer suit,
apparently belonging to a better class, looking
sneeringly at the great excitement of the "Paesani."</p>

<p>His dark, sparkling eyes, encased in blue-shaded
rings, had a demoniacal glitter. He was a tall,
athletic man, with a constant sneer on his red
lips. The fairly chiseled lineaments were blotted
by dissipation, and blackened and distorted by the
baleful fire of fierce passions. The bushy eyebrows,
that nearly met each other, were of the kind
to exercise an uncanny attraction upon trusting
innocent girls by looking into their depths.</p>

<p>The distant strains of three gaily-clad musicians
with fiddles and horns seemed to electrify the
crowd. The ragged youth began to dance, the old
paesani threw their shabby looking caps, in the
air, while the little barefooted lazzaroni, his
face black with dirt, ran ahead of the anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
expected procession, splitting his throat with
shrill cries of "Evviva," and gesticulating
frantically.</p>

<p>Only the tall gentleman, with a constant sneer
on his red lips, stood apparently unmoved in the
same place, gazing at the scene enacted before his
eyes with great contempt. Observing him at close
range one could perceive, in his dark sinister eyes,
the consuming fire of a sinful passion, a volcanic
fire it seemed, like that which rose and fell on the
summit of the neighboring Vesuvius, devastating
in its destructiveness.</p>

<p>He had seen the fair Concetta at Castellamare
for the first time, and since then he could not
forget her lovely face; day and night it haunted him,
that merry, mirthful face that spoke of pure
maidenliness. The sweetness and childlike pureness of
the girl's exterior attracted him. It was something
new in his dissipated life, something he had to
conquer.</p>

<p>Even at the gaming tables of Nice and Monte
Carlo, and at the wild orgies carried on there by
the dissipated sons of nobility, he seemed to see
her standing before him, smiling sweetly, while
her blue innocent-looking eyes shone at him like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
spotless mirrors.</p>

<p>After a short time he had discovered that she
came twice a week to Castellamare, on Mondays in
her father's fishing boat, while on Saturdays in
the company of a maid carrying stone pitchers to
the well, "Stabilimento," where six different
healing springs gush out of the mountain side. When
the flames on top of the Vesuvius burst forth
vehemently illuminating Naples, Castellamare and
all other little hamlets far and near the springs
are overflowing with boiling water, but the moment
the flame diminishes, the water grows cold
and gradually disappears.</p>

<p>The young rogue made good use of these days; as if
by chance, he always strolled along the same path
to the springs. If it rained, he was promptly at
hand with an umbrella; if, on the other hand, the
sun shone down oppressively on the overheated
Concetta, the same rescuer in need was at hand
again, gallantly offering his English parasol,
and always walking a little further with her. The
sunny nature of the young girl shone out of her
splendid blue eyes, bright and beaming as a May
morning. She trusted every one, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
this handsome gentleman, who treated her always
with such exquisite courtesy, as if she had been
one of the daughters of the Lords of Torre del
Greco, whom she saw passing on the Corso di Santa
Lucia, either on horseback or in a luxurious
carriage. Who would be likely to have any evil
designs against her? Old and young loved her in
the village, and the poor and sick had learned to
bless her for three miles round. Having grown
up in her village home, and blossomed there like
a wild rose, she had only known one great sorrow
in her young life, that of losing her beloved
mother when she was very young. Her merriment,
her happy singing, brightened up the dark, lonely
house of the gloomy old man.</p>

<p>However, since she had made the acquaintance of the
gentleman with the ensnaring eyes, she had changed
greatly. She was often lost in amazement&mdash;though
not in his company, but when alone in her little
bed-chamber, where the observing eyes of her
anxious father could not watch her.</p>

<p>There she sat, her large blue eyes staring out of
the window, with a feeling of overflowing joy,
that filled her heart, a feeling she could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
explain to herself, especially at his approach,
the violent beating of something within her that
threatened at times to take her breath away.</p>

<p>"Mia cara Concetta, I love you madly," had he not
long since whispered in her ear. He has said <i>that</i>
to her, the common-place daughter of the "Paesano"
Niccolo Gallioti. But his dark, passionate-looking
eyes made her tremble. She did not know why.</p>

<p>"If he could see me now in my new Sunday dress!"
she thought, her glance sweeping over the crowd,
as she passed along, surrounded by all the youths
and maidens of the village, in her red petticoat
and bodice of black silk, with snow white muslin
sleeves. "There! Santissima Madonna." "He is
waiting for me," she whispered happily, while a
blush brighter than the red silk of her dress
overspread her lovely face.</p>

<p>But not for all the bunches of red grapes she
was so fond of would she have raised her eyes, for
fear the youths and maidens might have read in
them the delight of her heart at seeing the man
she loved and was loved by such a man!&mdash;the violent
beating within her increased at this thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"Madonna!" She looked at the soft blue sky and
the waving cactus plants in the distance. Tears of
joy filled her eyes, while the golden sunshine filled
every nook and corner in Nature's great realm.</p>

<p>Arriving at the house, she found the maid busily
engaged in preparing the feast. The men were
beginning to place large tables in the garden
under the orange trees. Then they rolled out large
casks of the new wine from the cellar. Concetta
had just put on her apron, busily engaged in
carrying out a tray full of dishes into the gaily
decorated garden, when the door burst open. Her
father stood at the entrance, with his cap in his
hand, bowing reverentially to a gentleman, begging
him to honor his house by entering and participating
in the general frolic of the day.</p>

<p>A loud crash was heard. Concetta recognized him
at once, the gentleman with the ensnaring eyes,
and, delighted as she was, had dropped the
large Sunday tray, with all the special dishes
which only appeared on the Sunday table for
special occasions. She was startled and happy
at the same time, and hardly heard the irate
father's words of blame. The voice of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
lazzaroni was heard outside singing "Napoli
Bella." She looked through the window, and San
Francesco, on his pedestal, smiled at her. She
turned about, and met his burning glances. Her
cheeks crimsoned; she was in a confusion when
those dark fascinating eyes actually followed
her wherever she went.</p>

<p>He sat by her side at the table, calling her,
Concetta Gallioti, endearing names, and squeezing
her hand tenderly whenever the father was not
looking in their direction. And when she found
his eyes constantly fastened upon her face, she
felt like crying and laughing at the same time,
though it looked as if she were even too shy for
that.</p>

<p>Her innocent face was like the clear water of
the Spring at Castellamare. He observed her
closely, knew the symptoms and smiled maliciously,
considering it an auspicious omen in his well-tried
loving-making scheme.</p>

<p>The evening breezes rose and sank solemnly through
the little green olive trees in the distance.
The tables were cleared away, the meal was over
and the three grotesque musicians, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
feasting convivially, were sounding their
instruments with special vigor. The dance began.
All eyes were turned on Concetta, as she opened
the rustic ball with the interesting stranger
beneath the orange trees.</p>

<p>Her little heart felt as though it would burst
with joy in the consciousness that he had eyes and
ears for none but her, and scarcely seemed to see
the most renowned beauties of the village. The
whole evening he danced only with her&mdash;and what
things he whispered in her ear! Her fair cheeks
still clothed themselves in red&mdash;and the more they
did so, the more eloquent grew his lips and the
more terrifying in its passion his burning gaze.</p>

<p class="center"><big>II.</big></p>


<p>At Torre del Greco, in his dining-hall with its
lofty windows, the Baron di Pavichino sat at
breakfast. His bushy eyebrows contracted darkly
when the long-expected visit of his nephew
Luigi was announced to him.</p>

<p>Luigi di Pavichino, the passionate lover of the
fair Concetta, now entered the room, pale and
weary-eyed. For four days he had not been seen
in the Palazzo di Pavichino, although not long
before he had become engaged to his rich cousin.
The fear of exposing himself to her displeasure
now brought him here, after changing his clothes
for a little more formal attire than that in which
he had appeared at the peasants' festival, to
explain his absence by a plausible story.</p>

<p>"<i>Per Bacco!</i> Lucetta was looking for you in
vain yesterday and the day before!" began the
old Baron sternly, plucking at his gray beard in
a way that betokened displeasure. "If you are
beginning already to provide such disappointments
for your future wife, my dear Luigi, then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
would possibly be more sensible to call the
engagement off while there is yet time."</p>

<p>Luigi trembled at these words of his wealthy
uncle. In fact, this marriage was his only plank
of salvation, to which he clung with desperate
grasp like a man fighting for life in the waves&mdash;to
which he must cling in order to bring any order
into his ruined financial position, which he
carefully concealed from his suspecting uncle, and
which had to be retrieved as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The fact that the estate inherited from his
father, including farms and factories, was
mortgaged up to the last cent, would have been
sufficient to jeopardize his relations to his
unattractive but richly-dowered cousin. He knew
the verdict. A long-drawn sigh was the only answer
he gave to himself, and besides, there was his
incapability of meeting his notes indorsed by
friends, falling due within a short time for
considerable amounts contracted at the gaming
table. Sums which had to be paid because they
were debts of honor, for which he pledged his
"parole d'honneur."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me, dear uncle," he began stumblingly,
with these reflections in mind.</p>

<p>"I went to see the Padre at the Monastery to
tell him of my engagement and there&mdash;the kind
monk&mdash;the harvest&mdash;the new wine&mdash;"</p>

<p>The weatherbeaten features of the old nobleman
took on a more cheerful expression at these
words.</p>

<p>"Per bacco!" he began, smacking his lips and
winking slyly, "it must have been the new Lacrima
Christi wine I sent him last week, which has made
all the mischief. Ho! ho! if that's the case, my
dear boy, you will soon taste the wine that will
be worth the tasting," he added with a broad grin,
smacking his lips again in a manner attributable
to the thorough knowledge of an old wine gourmand.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, the same Lacrima Christi will
be served at your wedding next month."</p>

<p>The atmosphere was sultry, but he shivered; and
if a mirror could have been held before his
eyes he would have startled back alarmed from
the gray stony face so unlike his.</p>

<p>"Next month?" he stammered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Until now he tried to forget the whole affair; her
image was so utterly driven from his fickle heart
as if it were buried twenty feet under the ruins
of Herculaneum.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Luigi, I shall write at once to
Torre Annunziata, and then we will celebrate a
merry wedding and invite all&mdash;Why, what's the
matter?" he asked greatly bewildered. "What
a wry face you are making?"</p>

<p>"It is the pleasure&mdash;the unlooked-for surprise,&mdash;"
stammered Luigi with difficulty, while his pale face
grew a shade paler. The sweet face of Concetta, with
the bewitching dimples from which little mocking
Cupids seemed to peep out, challenging him like a
siren to a kiss; her silvery laughter, her deep blue
eyes like a fairy's&mdash;all that came up before his
interior vision with intoxicating strength, while
the thought that in four weeks he would be called
upon to plight his troth to his unlovely cousin
made him shudder.</p>

<p>Still he was careful not to drop the veil that
hid his real thoughts so carefully in the presence
of his suspicious uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pleasure? Ho! ho! my dear Luigi, I thought
as much. Young men, young men! I have not
forgotten my own youth yet&mdash;a little wild it was."
He chuckled half to himself, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Can I&mdash;see my <i>fiancee</i> now?" Luigi asked, in
a half stifled voice.</p>

<p>"Now? So early? No, dear boy, she is still
among her pillows&mdash;dreaming of you! <i>Per Dio!</i>
today, though, is the great festival of Saint
Cecelia. Our good neighbors from Torre del Greco,
Portici, and Torre Annunziata will be sure to
gather at Castellamare. We must go too. You shall
go with Lucetta in my victoria with the four fiery
Arabs, and I will follow the happy pair in a
plainer carriage," continued the old baron with
nods of pleasure.</p>

<p>It was at the same festival, at the chapel of
Saint Cecelia, that he hoped this very evening to
meet Concetta. The room seemed to spin round him
and grow dark. "By your leave, my dear uncle, I
must go at once to the club. You know,
the joyful news&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of your engagement?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't you mentioned it yet to your friends,"
he cried, a picture of wild-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>"To be sure I have, but&mdash;the early date of the
wedding&mdash;" he hastened to reply in a dull voice,
wiping the cold perspiration from his brow.</p>

<p>Catching up his hat and cane, he took a hasty
leave from his Uncle, with the promise to come
back punctually at four o'clock. He rushed away
tortured by this dreaded thought in mind; but he
had to see the small army of creditors and keep
them at bay with their insolent demands for
money, which were becoming intolerable until
after the most dreaded wedding.</p>

<p class="center"><big>III.</big></p>


<p>In Castellamare every year little shrines are
erected for the feast of St. Cecelia as far as the
Hotel di Stabia, which is close to the beautiful
bay of Naples, known to the tourists of all nations.
In these shrines, decorated with silken draperies
of different colors, immense wax tapers are burning,
amid which roughly painted images of the
wonder-working saint are seen shining out mercifully
in the brilliant afternoon sun.</p>

<p>She looked down with mild eyes, upon the devout
multitude, that hung up their votive offerings
of waxen hands, feet and hearts with tearful eyes.
Then deep in prayer they besought through her
the blessed Virgin's help for their various ills
and woes; kissing devoutly the silken drapery.</p>

<p>Concetta in her new Sunday dress stood there
among the praying throng. After praying for
a while she moved towards the Holy shrine; her
eyes moistened when she fastened with trembling
hands a little waxen heart to the drapery looking
up imploringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw her benignant gaze, and knelt down,
confessing all to the wonder-working saint, and
besought her to heal her sick heart. She hardly
knew what oppressed her so, and what made her
so immensely happy, at the same time. To her,
woods and fields were indeed vocal, every flitting
bird and gurgling brook, every passing cloud and
whispering breeze brought messages of love from
him. To the mercy of God and the love of Christ
she now committed her love. Today in the boundless
reverence and religious enthusiasm she felt
the need of his presence so much more.</p>

<p>She looked right and left. "Something must
have happened," she murmured to herself, greatly
disappointed, as it was almost twilight, and nowhere
was to be seen the tall imposing figure of
the fascinating man so dear to her. The sun had
gone down and the shadows of the summer evening
commenced to gather in the near forest, and
climbed, like trooping spirits, up the rocky mountain
side.</p>

<p>"He was always so punctual," her voice faltered
suddenly, and it grew dark before her eyes;
she trembled so that she was obliged to grasp
one of the large candle-holders near her in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to keep her from falling to the ground.</p>

<p>An elegant carriage with four horses had just
dashed by, in which she fancied she saw her lover
with a richly dressed lady; her heart contracted
painfully. Sadly, with downcast eyes praying
continually, she took her way back to the village.</p>

<p>Although with her pure and simple views of
life, there was no room for doubt in her loving
heart, still the disquieting thoughts that he must
be rich and of high position, she could not keep
altogether away. How else could he be driving
about with a signora apparently of nobility?
Involuntarily, hot tears trickled down her red
cheeks out of the great blue eyes, like drops of
rain from a patch of blue sky.</p>

<p>When Luigi came to the village on the following
day he found Concetta's eyes swollen with
weeping. She scarcely dared to raise them, still
heavy with tears, to his face, for fear he should
read in them her great love for him.</p>

<p>Luigi Pavichino, the young <i>roue</i>, who had
succeeded quickly enough with his flattering words
in making her forget the cause of her secret grief,
now laughed lightly with a merriment that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
none too pleasant a sound, as if he were well used
to such scenes of jealousy. He called her his
dear little bride, whom he loved and would always
love, and therewith he kissed her rosy lips
passionately, assuring her on his honor that he had
been driving in no carriage, but had been at the
monastery with the Padre, and then at five o'clock
had come to Saint Cecelia's shrine, without seeing
her.</p>

<p>The nearer the wedding day approached, the oftener
Luigi came to the village, assuring her always
of the unchangeableness of his love.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>




<p class="center"><big>IV.</big></p>


<p>The old cloister of Santa Croce, with its classic
columns, had today a festive appearance. In front
of the garden, sloping down at the mountain's
side, one gets a glimpse at the river Sarno, where
the Porta di Stabia once was located, and the
image of Minerva in terra cotta&mdash;the guardian
Deity of Pompeii, was excavated intact, now in the
Museum at Naples.</p>

<p>The old chapel was gayly decorated with rare
flowers and tropical plants today, and the finest
adornments of the ancient cloister, which had
slumbered peacefully and been forgotten in their
cupboards for a century, were brought out by the
serving brothers, and cleansed and dusted of their
cobwebs. They whispered excitedly putting their
heads together, for the marriage of a high-born
couple was a rare event within these ancient walls.</p>

<p>The fat prior smiled in the triple folds of his
chin, on all the preparations, with quite unusual
benevolence. His little steel-gray eyes, keen and
shrewd in their glance, fairly sparkled as he
thought of the rich fee which would come to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
cloister on such an occasion from a generous noble
house.</p>

<p>The cook of the monastery, Brother Salvatore,
had some days earlier announced the festive event
to Concetta's father, who supplied them with fish
on fast-days. Concetta was quite childishly
delighted. A noble wedding&mdash;the handsome pair&mdash;the
rich costumes&mdash;all that she had never seen in her
whole life; so she teased her father until he
promised to take her to the wedding. Her cheeks
glowed, her big eyes sparkled with pleasure, when
she was sitting in the boat in her Sunday best and
thinking of all the splendors that were going to
be exhibited before her.</p>

<p>"If I understood aright the look Saint Cecelia
gave me, I shall soon be standing there too!" she
whispered to herself with a happy smile, while
her father sat opposite her and plied the oars
with accustomed hands. "Oh, the happiness, the
happiness of belonging to him!" she went on in
her whispered colloquy with herself, both hands
clasped before her face, blushing with maidenly
modesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Gloomy clouds began to obscure the sun. The
magnificent landscape was in a few minutes wrapped,
as it were, in a dark veil of mist. With shining
eyes she sat in the boat watching the sky, and
drinking draughts of joy with which mingled no
drop of sin or selfishness in its crystal waves of
purity; for she had grown up with nature as
ignorant as her plants at home, of the roar and
strife, the burning hate and cunning intrigue of
the great world of men and women.</p>

<p>Frequent puffs of wind made the boat now tremble
and rock. The fear of an approaching storm had laid
hold of the animal world as well; the terrified
sea-gulls flew wildly over Concetta's head, while a
hideous owl in the neighboring olive-grove uttered
its long-drawn, harsh notes, which floated out over
the river. Concetta saw and heard nothing. Her
thoughts were with the man to whom she had given
herself in almost superhuman love, whom she was
tempted to adore like the holy image of Christ
before which she knelt in lowly reverence,
imploring His blessing on her beloved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard the sound of the great bell, which
was only rung on great occasions; the nearer she
came, the more joyfully beat her heart. A
gaily-decked steamer lay already at the landing
stage, so that they had to go a little further in
order to land. They had no sooner found a place
where they could moor their boat than Concetta with
impatient haste sprang ashore. They then climbed
the steep hill as quickly as possible. Great
raindrops fell again, and began to wet Concetta's
Sunday dress.</p>

<p>At last they reached the cloister; but they had
come near missing the ceremony. The solemn tones
of the organ were still sounding impressively
through the chapel. Concetta, with shining eyes
and wet through and through, was standing near
the chapel door, contemplating the undreamed-of
splendor of costumes of the high-born ladies.
The bridal pair, surrounded by wedding guests
congratulating them heartily, were not yet
visible.</p>

<p>"Now! now!" there was a general movement
towards the outer door of the chapel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here they are coming now," whispered Concetta
with sparkling eyes full of expectation, to
her father, whose head was bowed reverently.
Everybody rushed on in order to have an
advantageous place when the bridal party passed.</p>

<p>Girls all in white came first, carrying bouquets
in their hands, and then Luigi&mdash;pale and
haggard&mdash;looking like a bad conscience personified;
and on his arm came the bride all in white!</p>

<p>Concetta saw and heard no more.</p>

<p>The tortured image of Saint Antoni in the entrance
stared ghostly at her, dripping drops of blood.
The decaying walls of the old cloister tottered
about her, flames sprang up towards her from
yawning abysses; lightning shot across her brain,
and Beelzebub with his infernal band gnashed his
teeth at her in a laugh of malicious triumph.</p>

<p>She recoiled, dazed with awe-struck terror
without a sound, without a cry she moved
unobserved by the jostling crowd behind Luigi. Her
blue eyes wide open never turned from him an instant,
as if struck dumb by a horror too great for
words or cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>A little keen steel blade was glistening in her
hand, and the next instant Luigi was stabbed
through his treacherous heart. He fell senseless
at the feet of his newly wedded bride.</p>

<p>The frightened wedding guests, fearing a fainting
spell, rushed to him, but the blood was now
flowing freely from the spot where she had
stabbed him. Nobody saw her do it. He was quickly
carried into the monastery, followed by the
wedding guests.</p>

<p>Concetta uttered a wild cry, and rushed weeping
aloud down the hill towards the harbor. It was
already dark; the wind was now blowing with the
vehemence of a hurricane over the foaming waters,
and the roar of thunder shook the bathing-houses
on the left hand side of the harbor. Concetta,
with a sudden headlong rush, breathless and
horrified had reached the landing pier. With a
loud cry she threw herself into the foaming
waves and disappeared.</p>

<p>At the same moment her father and brother
Salvatore, running after her, had reached the
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Niccolo, trembling in every limb, was at
first rendered almost helpless with horror; but
the despair which began to hold sway over him
gave him now superhuman strength. With frantic
haste he unfastened his little boat, and rowed
gesticulating wildly to the spot where he had seen
her sink. He loved his only daughter with a love
that was akin to idolatry. His grey hair fluttered
wildly about his furrowed and heated brow; great
tears trickled down his dark cheeks, and panting
aloud he gazed down into the foaming gloomy
depths.</p>

<p>"Santissima!" he cried aloud, "Madonna!
My greatest treasure&mdash;my only child! Have mercy!"</p>

<p>A vivid flash of lightning illuminated the
stormy surface and then&mdash;he saw the red dress
floating upon the waves. "Cara mia!" he cried,
with a stammering tongue, wild with joy when he
had grasped her and dragged the dear form into
the boat. Calling her ceaselessly by endearing
names, he pressed her to his heart as though to
bring back warmth and life to her young body,
and covered her dear face with passionate kisses,
but the beautiful head fell back pale and lifeless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the great blue eyes were closed; she was dead.</p>

<p>With horror in his wide strained eyes, and pallor
on his quivering lips, he gazed at the prostrate
form before him, the lifeless eyes staring now
blankly at the sky,&mdash;the hue of life and exuberant
health still glowing on the full cheeks adorned
with every grace of youth and beauty.</p>

<p>"Morte&mdash;morte!" stammered the father, frantic
with grief, tearing his grey hair despairingly.
No merry glance, no roguish smile she had any
more for him.</p>

<p>"Figlia mia morte!" he cried, beating his
breast wildly. "You will be avenged, none of
them will escape!" And holding the dead Concetta
in his arms, he stood there erect with flaming
eyes and panting breath swearing the oath of
the deadly feud between him and the family,
clenching his fists threateningly. The mighty
grief tore at his heart strings and finally,
brought bitter tears to his burning eyes, great
drops streaming down over his grief-stricken
face.</p>

<p>On the pier, Brother Salvatore had sunk upon
his knees and clasped the silver crucifix, which
hung at his side by a cord. Holding it out
towards the boat, he raised his voice,
"Benedizione!" he cried aloud. A shiver shook
his emaciated frame as if the spectacle which
he beheld, would have burned itself indelibly
upon his memory.</p>

<p>The lightning flashes showed from afar the
silver cross as it were&mdash;a symbol of atonement
and&mdash;forgiveness.</p>
